# Content Scoring Rubric

## How to Use
Before delivering ANY piece of content, score it against this rubric.
If total score < 70, revise before delivering.
Share the score with the user so they understand the quality bar.

**Max score: 110 points** (100 base + 10 algorithm/format bonuses)
Ship at 80+. Revise if below 70.

## Scoring Criteria (100 points base + 10 bonus)

### 1. HOOK STRENGTH (25 points)
Ask: "Would I stop scrolling for this?"
- 25 — Impossible to ignore. Creates immediate curiosity or resonates deeply.
- 20 — Strong. Most people would pause.
- 15 — Decent. Some people would stop.
- 10 — Weak. Generic or forgettable.
- 0-5 — Bad. Would be scrolled past immediately.

### 2. CLARITY (20 points)
Ask: "Does a 12-year-old understand the main point?"
- 20 — Crystal clear. One idea, communicated perfectly.
- 15 — Clear with minor confusion possible.
- 10 — Somewhat clear but requires effort.
- 5 — Confusing or vague.
- 0 — Incomprehensible.

### 3. VALUE DELIVERY (25 points)
Ask: "Is the reader better off after reading this?"
- 25 — Genuinely useful. Reader learns something, feels something, or is moved to act.
- 20 — Good value. Mostly useful with some filler.
- 15 — Some value but padded.
- 10 — Low value. More style than substance.
- 0-5 — No real value.

### 4. SHAREABILITY (15 points)

- 0 — No.

### 5. CTA / CLOSE (15 points)

## Quick Self-Review Checklist
Before scoring, run through these:
- [ ] First sentence would stop the scroll
- [ ] No paragraph longer than 4 lines
- [ ] Every sentence earns its place (cut the rest)
- [ ] Specific details, not vague claims ("3x more" not "much better")
- [ ] Ends with ONE clear action, not three
- [ ] Reads like a human wrote it, not a robot
- [ ] No filler phrases ("In conclusion", "It's important to note", "As we can see")
- [ ] Emotion present (curiosity, surprise, relief, excitement, or validation)

## Universal Algorithm Bonuses (apply to any platform)

These two bonuses can push any piece past 100 — reserved for content that's both structurally and algorithmically excellent.

- **+5: Proven viral format** — Content uses one of the documented viral structures (Unpopular Opinion, I Spent X, Nobody Talks About, Thread: How I, Contrarian Take, Simple Framework). Partial credit not awarded — it either uses the format or it doesn't.
  - See: `references/viral-formats.md`

- **+5: Platform algorithm optimized** — Content is specifically tuned for the target platform's current algorithm signals (correct link placement, hook timing, engagement triggers, format for distribution). Requires documented awareness of 2026 platform signals.
  - See: `references/platform-algorithms.md`
