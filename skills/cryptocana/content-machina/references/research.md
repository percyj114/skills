# Research Workflow

## Step 1: Find the Angle
Search for: `[topic] + "why" OR "how" OR "surprising" OR "data"`
Look for: contrarian takes, surprising stats, underreported angles

## Step 2: Validate Demand
Search for: `[topic] site:reddit.com` or `[topic] site:quora.com`
Look for: what questions people are actually asking

## Step 3: Find Supporting Data
Search for: `[topic] statistics 2024 OR 2025`
Prioritize: .gov, .edu, major publications, peer-reviewed sources

## Step 4: Find the Hook
The best hooks are:
- A surprising stat ("80% of X do Y")
- A contrarian claim ("Everyone says X, but actually Y")
- A relatable struggle ("If you've ever felt X, this is for you")
- A bold prediction ("X will change everything in 2025")

## Step 5: Synthesize
Combine your research into 3–5 key points that support your angle.
