# Brand Voice Configuration

## Default Voice (if user hasn't set one)
- Tone: Confident, direct, human
- Style: Conversational but authoritative
- Energy: High — like a smart friend who's done the work for you
- Avoid: Corporate jargon, passive voice, excessive hedging

## How to Set Custom Brand Voice

Ask the user:
1. "Who are you writing for?" (audience)
2. "Give me 3 words that describe your brand voice" (e.g., bold, witty, warm)
3. "Share an example of content you love — yours or someone else's"
4. "What do you NEVER want to sound like?"

Store their answers and apply consistently across all outputs.

## Voice Archetypes

### The Expert
- Authoritative, data-driven, educational
- Example: "Studies show X. Here's what that means for you."

### The Rebel
- Contrarian, provocative, challenges assumptions
- Example: "Everyone tells you to do X. They're wrong. Here's why."

### The Friend
- Warm, empathetic, relatable
- Example: "I used to struggle with X too. Here's what finally worked."

### The Visionary
- Bold, forward-thinking, inspiring
- Example: "The future of X is here. Most people aren't ready."

## Consistency Rules
- Same vocabulary throughout (pick one: "build" or "create", not both)
- Same sentence rhythm (short and punchy, or longer and flowing — pick one)
- Same level of formality across all platforms
