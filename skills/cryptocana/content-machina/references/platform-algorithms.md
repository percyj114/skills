# Platform Algorithms — What Actually Gets Reach in 2026

Stop guessing. These are the real signals each algorithm rewards right now.

## Twitter/X

### What the Algorithm Actually Rewards
The X algorithm is an engagement-velocity engine. The first 30 minutes decide everything.

**Primary signals (ranked by weight):**
1. **Replies in first 30 min** — the heaviest signal. Controversial, thought-provoking, or question-ending posts win here.
2. **Bookmarks** — X treats bookmarks as high-intent engagement. A post with 20 bookmarks > a post with 200 likes.
3. **Retweets from high-follower accounts** — one retweet from a 50K account beats 100 from 500-follower accounts.
4. **Click-through on "Show more"** — long-form posts that make people expand get signal. Tease in the first line.
5. **Reply-from-author** — replying to your own thread quickly boosts it. Do this within 10 min of posting.

**What it punishes:**
- External links in the body of the post (kills reach by ~60%). Put links in replies.
- Low engagement rate relative to impressions. One bad post can suppress the next.
- Posting and ghosting. Stay active in the replies for 30 min after posting.

**Tactical playbook:**
- Post between 7–9am or 6–9pm local time for your audience
- End threads with a question that invites a take, not just "What do you think?"
- The first tweet is the whole game. If it doesn't land, nothing else matters.
- Repurpose your top-performing posts every 60–90 days. The algo doesn't remember; your audience does (mostly).
- Quote-tweet your own posts with commentary to restart engagement.

## LinkedIn

### What the Algorithm Actually Rewards
LinkedIn's algorithm rewards expertise + emotion. It's the only platform where long-form regularly outperforms short.

**Primary signals:**
1. **Dwell time** — how long people linger on your post. Long posts with white space win because people scroll slowly.
2. **Early comments** (first 60–90 min) — LinkedIn heavily weights comment velocity. Ask a question in the last line.
3. **"Relevant" reactions** (Love, Insightful) > basic Likes — the algo treats them as stronger signals.
4. **Profile clicks** — if people click your profile from a post, that's a strong relevance signal.

**What it punishes:**
- External links in post body (same as X — put them in comments)
- Too-frequent posting (>1x/day tanks distribution)
- Engagement bait ("Type YES if you agree") — LinkedIn filters this explicitly

**Content that wins on LinkedIn:**
- **Personal story + professional lesson** (the "I failed, here's what I learned" arc)
- **Contrarian industry take** with receipts
- **Niche expertise** — the more specific the industry insight, the more it spreads within that industry
- **Visible vulnerability** — admitting a mistake outperforms success porn

**Tactical playbook:**
- Use line breaks aggressively. Every 1–2 sentences max. White space = dwell time.
- First line must be the hook — no "I'm excited to share..." intros. Ever.
- Post 3–5x per week. Consistency > frequency.
- Comment on 10 relevant posts BEFORE posting your own. Warms the algo.
- Native documents/carousels (PDFs) get massive reach — algorithm loves them.

## Instagram

### What the Algorithm Actually Rewards
Instagram in 2026 = Reels first, everything else second.

**Primary signals:**
1. **Watch time / Retention rate** — For Reels, completing the video or rewatching triggers massive distribution.
2. **Saves** — the #1 signal for static posts. Saves = "I want to come back to this." Instagram treats it as much stronger than likes.
3. **Shares to DMs/Stories** — when people send your content to friends, it signals relevance.
4. **Profile visits from Reels** — if non-followers visit your profile after seeing a Reel, it gets pushed harder.

**What it punishes:**
- Watermarks from other platforms (TikTok logo → Instagram hates it, buries it)
- Low-resolution content
- Long caption hooks that don't pay off
- Inconsistency (posting 3x one week, 0 the next)

**Reels specifically:**
- The hook must land in the first **1 second** visually and **3 seconds** verbally
- Add captions/text overlay — 70%+ of Reels are watched without sound
- 7–15 seconds for max reach, 30–60 seconds for saves + thoughtful content
- Hook → tension → payoff structure. Don't front-load everything.
- Use trending audio (within first 72 hours of it trending) for 3x distribution boost

**Static posts:**
- Carousels > single images for saves
- Slide 1 = hook (treat it like a billboard you drive past at 60mph)
- Last slide = CTA or shareable quote

## TikTok

### What the Algorithm Actually Rewards
TikTok is pure meritocracy. Zero followers, first video, you can still go viral. The system doesn't care about you — it cares about the content.

**Primary signals:**
1. **Completion rate** — the most important metric. If people finish the video, it gets pushed. If they don't, it dies.
2. **Rewatches** — a video someone watches twice tells TikTok "this is really good." Short videos that loop well win.
3. **Shares** — when people send videos to friends via DM or share to other platforms, massive signal.
4. **Comments** — especially comments that spark threads or debates.

**What it punishes:**
- Slow intros. You have literally 1 second. If you don't hook immediately, they scroll.
- Low audio quality (phone mic in a loud room = buried content)
- Anything that feels staged or over-produced in certain niches (authenticity ≠ bad production, but fake authenticity is spotted instantly)

**The 1-second hook rule:**
Your video must answer "why should I keep watching?" in the first second — visually or with words on screen. Not in 3 seconds. One second.

**Retention = Reach:**
- Script your video to remove every unnecessary word
- Pattern interrupts every 5–7 seconds (cut to different angle, text pops on screen, new hook)
- Strong ending that either: loops back to start, delivers the punchline, or ends on a cliffhanger
- "Wait for it" and "stay until the end" = engagement bait (still works when earned, not forced)

**Tactical playbook:**
- Post 1–3x/day during growth phase
- Use 3–5 hashtags (niche + mid + broad). Don't stuff.
- Reply to comments with videos — this is a massive underused reach multiplier
- Trending sounds in the first 48–72h of trending = algorithmic tailwind

## Newsletter

### What the Algorithm Actually Rewards
Email has no algorithm — except the spam filter and your readers' habit. But your open rate IS your algorithm. Low opens → Gmail thinks you're spam → future emails buried.

**The subject line is 80% of the battle.**

**What drives opens:**
1. **Curiosity gap** — "The one mistake killing your content reach" > "5 Tips for Content Marketing"
2. **Specificity** — "How I got 4,200 signups in 72 hours" > "How I grew my email list"
3. **Personalization signals** — "[First name]" in subject still works, but "You're making this mistake" works even better
4. **Urgency/Recency** — "What changed in 2026" or "This just happened" triggers opens
5. **Short subjects** — 40 characters or less show fully on mobile. Most email is read on mobile.

**What tanks deliverability:**
- ALL CAPS in subject
- Spam trigger words: "free," "guarantee," "limited time," "act now," "click here"
- Low click-to-open rate over time (sending to non-openers kills your domain reputation)
- Inconsistent sending (skipping weeks, then 3 emails in 3 days)

**Content that drives clicks:**
- One CTA per email. Not three. One.
- The preview text (first line of email body) is the second subject line — treat it as one
- Story → insight → action structure. Don't bury the insight.
- "PS:" lines get read more than almost anything else in the email body

**Tactical playbook:**
- Clean your list every 90 days. Remove people who haven't opened in 3+ months.
- Send at consistent times. Subscribers develop habits around your send time.
- Plain text emails often outperform HTML — feels more personal, less promotional
- A/B test subject lines (most ESPs let you do this free)
- Re-engagement campaign before you delete cold subscribers — sometimes 15% come back
