# Writing Guidelines

## Structure (HOOK → VALUE → CTA)

### Hook (first 2–3 sentences)
Must stop the scroll. Options:
- Bold claim
- Surprising stat
- Relatable pain point
- Provocative question

### Body (the value)
- Use short paragraphs (2–4 lines max)
- One idea per paragraph
- Use subheadings every 300 words
- Back claims with data or examples
- Write at 8th grade reading level (clear, not dumbed down)

### CTA (call to action)
Always end with ONE clear next step:
- "Reply with your biggest challenge"
- "Share this if it helped"
- "Try this today and let me know"

## Voice Principles
- Write like you talk (contractions, casual, human)
- Strong verbs over weak ones ("launch" not "initiate")
- Cut filler words ("very", "really", "just", "basically")
- Be specific ("3 hours" not "a long time")
- Show, don't tell

## Blog Post Structure
1. Hook (1 paragraph)
2. The problem (1–2 paragraphs)
3. Main points (3–5 sections with subheadings)
4. Conclusion + CTA (1 paragraph)
