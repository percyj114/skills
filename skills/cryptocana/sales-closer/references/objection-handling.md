# Objection Handling — The Closer Playbook

> Objections are not rejection. They're the prospect asking you to help them justify the decision they already want to make.

---

## The Framework: Acknowledge → Reframe → Close

Never argue. Never defend. Never panic.

1. **Acknowledge** — Validate the concern. Make them feel heard.
2. **Reframe** — Shift the lens. Change how they're looking at the problem.
3. **Close** — Move the conversation forward. Always end with a question.

---

## Objection 1: "It's Too Expensive" / "Not in Budget"

**What they really mean:** "I don't see enough value yet" or "I don't know if I can justify this."

### Acknowledge
> "I hear you — and I don't want to waste your time or mine if the numbers don't work. Budget is real."

### Reframe
> "Can I ask — is it that there's no budget, or that you haven't allocated budget for this yet? Because most of the [type of business] we work with didn't have a line item for this until they saw the ROI."
>
> Or: "What's the cost of *not* solving this? If [problem they named] is costing you [X hours / lost deals / churn], the question might be whether you can afford not to."

### Close
> "If the numbers made sense — if you could see a clear ROI in 90 days — is this something you'd want to move on?"

---

## Objection 2: "I Need to Think About It"

**What they really mean:** There's a concern they haven't told you yet.

### Acknowledge
> "Of course — this is a meaningful decision and I'd rather you take the time to be confident than rush into it."

### Reframe
> "I want to make sure I've given you everything you need to think it through. What specifically would you be thinking about? Is it the price, the timing, making sure it's the right fit?"

*(Let them answer. The real objection is usually in that answer.)*

### Close
> "So if I could address [the thing they named], would you feel confident moving forward today?"

---

## Objection 3: "We Already Have a Solution"

**What they really mean:** "I'm not convinced you're better than what I have."

### Acknowledge
> "That makes sense — you wouldn't be where you are without solving some version of this already."

### Reframe
> "I'm curious — what would need to be *different* about a new solution for you to even consider making a switch? What's the gap between what you have now and where you actually want to be?"

*(Let them describe the gap. Then show how you fill it.)*

### Close
> "It sounds like the main gap is [X]. That's exactly where we're different from [current tool]. Would it be worth a 20-minute demo to see if it actually moves the needle on that?"

---

## Objection 4: "It's Not the Right Time"

**What they really mean:** "It's not a priority right now" or "I'm afraid of change."

### Acknowledge
> "Timing matters — I get it. You're probably juggling a dozen things right now."

### Reframe
> "Can I ask — when *would* be the right time? What needs to happen before this becomes a priority?"
>
> Or: "The companies we work with often say it wasn't the right time — until they calculated how much they were losing each month by waiting. What's the cost of solving this 6 months from now instead of today?"

### Close
> "If we could find a way to make this low-friction to start — maybe a pilot, a small commitment to test the waters — would timing still be the issue?"

---

## Objection 5: "I Need to Talk to My Team / Boss"

**What they really mean:** "I'm not the decision maker" or "I want cover before I commit."

### Acknowledge
> "Totally — big decisions should involve the right people. Makes sense."

### Reframe
> "Who else would need to be on board for this to move forward? And what would *they* need to see to feel confident?"
>
> Then: "Would it help if we scheduled a quick call with you and [decision maker] together? I can walk through the relevant parts for them specifically — saves you from having to relay everything."

### Close
> "When do you think you'd be able to get 30 minutes with them? Let's get it on the calendar before it falls off everyone's radar."

---

## Objection 6: "Send Me More Info" (The Stall)

**What they really mean:** "I'm not interested enough to commit time right now" — or — "I want to exit the conversation politely."

### Acknowledge
> "Happy to — and I want to make sure I send you what's actually relevant, not just a big PDF that sits in your inbox."

### Reframe
> "What specifically would you want the info to answer? If I know that, I can send you exactly the right thing rather than everything."
>
> Or, if you sense disengagement: "I'll be honest — 'send me info' is usually how people politely say they're not interested. Which is totally fine. But if there *is* something that would make this worth exploring, I'd rather know now so we can figure out if it makes sense."

### Close
> "Would a 15-minute call next week be more useful than a document? I can walk you through exactly what's relevant to your situation and answer questions on the spot."

---

## Universal Principles

### Silence is your friend
After you reframe, stop talking. Let them sit with it. The first person to talk usually loses leverage.

### Never argue
The moment you argue, you've lost. Every defense makes the objection feel more valid.

### Isolate before you handle
> "Is that the only thing standing in the way, or are there other concerns?"
If there are multiple objections, handle the real one — not just the first one they voice.

### Test the close before you close
> "If we could solve that, would you be ready to move forward?"
Never invest in overcoming an objection that still won't get you a yes.
