# Cold Outreach Templates — The Closer Playbook

> Rules before templates: Lead with their problem. Make the ask easy. One CTA max.

---

## Template 1: Cold Email

**When to use:** First touch to a prospect who hasn't heard of you.

**Structure:** Problem → Credibility signal → CTA (3 sentences max)

**Variables:**
- `[First name]`
- `[Specific pain point relevant to their role/industry]`
- `[Social proof — company name, outcome, number]`
- `[Low-friction ask — 15 min, yes/no question]`

---

**Example:**

> Subject: [First name] — quick question
>
> Most [role]s I talk to are losing [specific pain — e.g., "10+ hours a week chasing unresponsive leads"]. We helped [Company X] [specific outcome — e.g., "cut their sales cycle by 30% in 60 days"]. Worth a 15-minute conversation?
>
> — [Your name]

---

**Variants:**

*Problem-first:*
> Subject: [Company name] + [your company]
>
> [First name] — noticed you're [doing X / using Y / growing in Z]. The biggest bottleneck we see for teams like yours is [specific pain]. We solved it for [similar company]. Open to a quick call?

*Question-hook:*
> Subject: Question for [First name]
>
> Are you currently [struggling with X / handling Y manually / using Z for this]? Asking because we just helped [company in same space] [specific outcome]. Happy to show you how if it's relevant.

---

**Rules:**
- Subject line: 3-5 words. No clickbait.
- No "I hope this finds you well." No "I wanted to reach out." Jump in.
- Never attach a pitch deck to a cold email. Ever.

---

## Template 2: LinkedIn DM

**When to use:** Warm-ish outreach to someone you've connected with or whose content you've engaged with.

**Structure:** Connection point → value signal → low-friction ask

**Variables:**
- `[First name]`
- `[Specific connection — saw your post, mutual contact, etc.]`
- `[Their pain or goal based on their profile/posts]`
- `[Outcome you can offer]`

---

**Example:**

> [First name] — saw your post about [topic] and it resonated. We've been helping [role/type of company] with [specific problem] — a lot of teams in your space are dealing with it right now. Would it be useful to share how we've approached it? Not a pitch — just a conversation.

---

**Variants:**

*After connecting:*
> Thanks for connecting. I work with [type of company] to [specific outcome]. Given your role at [their company], thought it might be worth sharing. Up for a quick chat?

*Referencing their content:*
> Your post on [topic] nailed it. We built [product/service] specifically because of that problem — helping [companies like theirs] [result]. Curious if you'd want to compare notes.

---

**Rules:**
- Never send a wall of text. Short = respect for their time.
- Don't pitch in the first message. Connect, then earn the right to pitch.
- Voice notes on LinkedIn perform well — use when appropriate.

---

## Template 3: Follow-Up Sequence (Day 1 / 3 / 7 / 14)

**When to use:** After any first touch (email, DM, call) with no response.

---

**Day 1 — The Bump**
*Context: Same thread as original message.*

> Just wanted to make sure this didn't get buried. Still think there's something worth discussing here. What does your calendar look like this week?

---

**Day 3 — New Angle**
*Context: New thread or fresh message.*

> [First name] — switching angles. Forgot to mention: [new piece of value — stat, case study, relevant insight].
>
> [Company similar to theirs] saw [specific result] in [timeframe]. Same situation. Thought it was worth sharing.
>
> Still open to a quick call if timing works.

---

**Day 7 — Direct Ask**
*Context: Short, direct, confident.*

> [First name] — I don't want to keep pinging you if this isn't relevant. Two questions:
>
> 1. Is [problem we solve] something you're actively working on?
> 2. If yes, is it worth 15 minutes to see if we can help?
>
> Either way, just let me know and I'll adjust accordingly.

---

**Day 14 — Soft Close / Breakup**
*Context: Low-pressure, final message.*

> I'll keep this short — this is my last follow-up. If the timing's off or it's not relevant, no hard feelings at all. But if [specific pain] becomes a priority in Q[X] or later in the year, happy to reconnect.
>
> Take care and good luck with [something relevant from their profile/company].
>
> — [Your name]

---

## Template 4: Breakup Email

**When to use:** After a full sequence with no response. Or when a prospect ghosts mid-conversation.

**Variables:**
- `[First name]`
- `[Original problem or opportunity]`

---

**Example:**

> Subject: Closing the loop
>
> [First name] — I've reached out a few times about [pain/opportunity] and haven't heard back. I get it — priorities shift, inboxes fill up. I'll stop following up after this one.
>
> If things change and [problem] becomes a priority, I'm easy to find.
>
> Good luck either way.
>
> — [Your name]

---

**Why this works:** Breakup emails get responses. Permission to leave often triggers re-engagement. Send it and mean it — if they don't reply, move on.

---

## Template 5: Referral Ask

**When to use:** After a positive interaction — existing customer, warm conversation, mutual connection.

**Variables:**
- `[First name]`
- `[What you help with]`
- `[Ideal target profile — who you want to meet]`

---

**Example:**

> [First name] — really enjoyed [our conversation / working together on X].
>
> I'm always looking to connect with [founders / sales leaders / ops teams] who are dealing with [specific pain]. If anyone in your network comes to mind, an intro would mean a lot — even a "hey, you should talk to [your name]" goes a long way.
>
> And of course, happy to return the favor any time.

---

**Shorter version (for DM):**

> Quick ask — do you know anyone who's struggling with [pain] and might benefit from [what you do]? Even one intro would be huge.

## Universal Outreach Principles

| Rule | Why |
|------|-----|
| Lead with their problem, not your product | They don't care about you yet |
| One CTA per message | Options create paralysis |
| Short is respectful | Long emails = no reads |
| Personalize the first line | It's the only thing they read before deciding |
| Follow up 4-6x | Most deals close after touch 5 |
| Always have a reason to re-engage | New insight, case study, relevant article |
