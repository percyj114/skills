# Closing Techniques — The Closer Playbook

> The close isn't the end of the sale. It's the beginning of the relationship.

---

## The #1 Rule

**Never ask "do you want to buy?" — ask "what's our next step?"**

Asking to buy puts the prospect on the spot and forces a yes/no. Asking about next steps assumes agreement and moves the deal forward naturally. One question closes. The other stalls.

---

## Reading Buying Signals

Before you close, the prospect is already telling you they're ready. Watch for:

**Verbal signals:**
- Asking about pricing, implementation, or timelines
- Using "we" instead of "you": "How would *we* set this up?"
- Asking about specific features: "Does it integrate with our CRM?"
- Comparing to competitors: "How does this compare to [X]?"
- Talking about internal rollout: "Who on our team would use this?"

**Behavioral signals:**
- Leaning forward, nodding
- Taking notes during your pitch
- Asking follow-up questions with energy
- Bringing in another stakeholder mid-conversation

**When you see these signals: stop presenting and start closing.**

Most reps miss the moment because they keep talking. When you see buying signals — close.

## The 5 Closes

### 1. The Assumptive Close

**What it is:** You act as if the decision has already been made. Skip the "if" — go straight to "when" and "how."

**When to use:** When you've had a strong discovery, the prospect is engaged, and buying signals are present.

**How it sounds:**
> "Okay, so based on what you've told me — let's get you started. I'll send over the agreement today. Do you prefer to kick off next week or the week after?"

> "Let's map out the onboarding. Are you bringing in the full team or starting with just a few reps?"

> "I'll have the contract ready by end of day. Should I send it to you directly, or loop in someone else on your side?"

**Why it works:** It moves the conversation from "should I?" to "how do I?" — a much easier decision.

### 2. The Summary Close

**What it is:** Recap everything they've said — their pain, their goals, what they need — then connect it to your offer before asking for the next step.

**When to use:** Complex sales with multiple stakeholders, or when the conversation has covered a lot of ground.

**How it sounds:**
> "Let me make sure I have this right. You're dealing with [pain 1] and [pain 2], you need a solution before [timeline], and the most important thing for your team is [priority]. Based on all of that, here's what I'd recommend: [solution]. Does that feel like the right fit?"

> "We've covered a lot — so to summarize: your goal is [X], the blocker is [Y], and you need [Z] to make this work. Our [product/service] does exactly that. So — what's our next step?"

**Why it works:** Mirroring their own words back makes them feel understood and moves the conversation naturally toward commitment.

### 3. The Urgency Close (Ethical)

**What it is:** Create a genuine, honest reason to decide now. Not fake scarcity — real business consequences of waiting.

**When to use:** When the prospect is interested but stalling without a real reason.

**How it sounds:**
> "We have two onboarding slots open this month — I'd hate for you to wait another 30 days if we can get you started now."

> "The pricing we discussed is valid through [date]. After that, we move to the new rate. Happy to lock this in for you today."

> "Every week you're running on [current broken process] is costing you [X]. If we start now, you could have [outcome] by [date]. If we wait, that's another quarter of the same problem."

**Rules:**
- Only use if the urgency is real. Fake urgency destroys trust.
- Connect the urgency to their outcome, not your quota.

### 4. The Trial Close

**What it is:** A low-stakes question designed to test readiness and surface hidden objections before going for the full close.

**When to use:** Mid-conversation, when you're not sure where they stand. Use to check temperature without forcing a decision.

**How it sounds:**
> "Based on what I've shown you so far, does this feel like it could be a fit?"

> "If we could solve [specific pain they named], would this be something your team would actually use?"

> "Does this feel like it's solving the right problem?"

**Why it works:** If they say yes → close. If they say no or hesitate → you've surfaced the real objection before wasting time. Win either way.

### 5. The Next Step Close

**What it is:** The cleanest, least pushy close in the playbook. Instead of "do you want to buy?" — you simply ask what happens next.

**When to use:** Almost always. This is the default close for anyone who's had a good conversation.

**How it sounds:**
> "This feels like a strong fit — what's our next step?"

> "Based on everything we've talked about, I'd love to move forward. What do we need to do on your end to make that happen?"

> "I can have the agreement over to you today. What's the fastest path to getting this done on your side?"

**Why it works:**
- "Next step" is collaborative, not transactional
- It respects their process while keeping momentum
- If they're not ready, they'll tell you exactly why — which is just an objection you can handle

## The Post-Close Protocol

Once they say yes (or agree to a next step):

1. **Confirm the specifics:** Date, deliverables, who signs, what happens next
2. **Stop selling:** Do not keep pitching after the close. You'll unsell the deal.
3. **Send confirmation fast:** Agreement, recap email, or calendar invite within the hour
4. **Set expectations:** Tell them what happens next so there are no surprises
5. **Celebrate (internally):** Then stay focused on delivery

## Common Closing Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Kills Deals |
|---------|-------------------|
| Asking "do you want to buy?" | Forces yes/no, creates pressure |
| Closing before establishing pain | They don't feel the need yet |
| Over-explaining after they say yes | You'll give them reasons to change their mind |
| Taking "I need to think about it" at face value | Always dig for the real objection |
| Not asking for the close at all | Hoping they'll decide on their own (they won't) |
| Discounting without asking why | Trains prospects to always negotiate |

## The Closer's Mindset

You're not trying to trick anyone. You're helping people make a decision that's already good for them.

If your product is the right fit — closing is a service. Letting them stall is doing them a disservice.

Close with conviction. Close with care. Close every time.
