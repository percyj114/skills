## The Core Idea

Don't pitch features. Create pain. Then offer the cure.

SPIN works by guiding the prospect through a journey where *they* articulate the problem, *they* realize the consequences, and *they* conclude that they need a solution — ideally yours.

The salesperson who talks the least often wins.

## The Four Stages

### 1. Situation Questions
**Goal:** Understand their current state. Build context without wasting time.

Use sparingly — asking too many situation questions signals you didn't do your homework.

**Purpose:**
- Establish facts about their current setup
- Set the foundation for problem questions
- Show you understand their world

**Example Questions:**
- "How does your team currently handle [process]?"
- "What tools or systems are you using right now?"
- "How long has this been the way you operate?"
- "How many people are involved in this process?"
- "What does your current pipeline look like?"

**Rules:**
- Do your research before the call. LinkedIn, their website, recent news.
- 2-3 situation questions max before moving to problem questions.
- Every situation question should set up a problem question.

### 2. Problem Questions
**Goal:** Surface pain. Make the prospect name the problem themselves.

This is where deals start forming. When they say the problem out loud, it becomes real.

**Purpose:**
- Identify dissatisfaction with the current situation
- Get the prospect to articulate challenges in their own words
- Uncover hidden problems they haven't fully acknowledged

**Example Questions:**
- "What's the biggest frustration with how [process] works right now?"
- "Where do you feel like things slip through the cracks?"
- "What takes longer than it should?"
- "How often does [X] cause problems for your team?"
- "What do you wish you could change about your current setup?"
- "Is [current tool/process] giving you everything you need?"

**Rules:**
- Let them finish. Resist the urge to jump in with solutions.
- Paraphrase back: "So it sounds like [X] is costing you time/money/deals — is that right?"
- Go deeper with follow-ups: "Tell me more about that."

### 3. Implication Questions
**Goal:** Amplify the consequences. Make the pain feel urgent.

This is the most powerful and most underused stage. Small problems feel manageable. Implications make them feel costly.

**Purpose:**
- Connect the problem to business impact (revenue, time, morale, growth)
- Create urgency without manufacturing false pressure
- Make doing nothing feel riskier than making a change

**Example Questions:**
- "If this keeps happening, what does that mean for your team by end of quarter?"
- "How does that affect your ability to close deals / hit your numbers?"
- "What's the cost of not fixing this — in time, revenue, or headcount?"
- "How much is this slowing your team down on a weekly basis?"
- "If this problem gets worse, what's the worst-case outcome?"
- "How is this impacting your customers / retention / reputation?"

**Rules:**
- Don't exaggerate — help them *discover* the real impact, don't invent it.
- One strong implication question beats five weak ones.
- When they say "yeah, it's actually a big problem" — that's your green light.

### 4. Need-Payoff Questions
**Goal:** Get them to articulate why your solution is valuable. Let them sell themselves.

This is where you transition from pain to possibility — and the prospect does the heavy lifting.

**Purpose:**
- Make them imagine life with the problem solved
- Get them to state the benefits of a solution in their own words
- Create the emotional pull toward moving forward

**Example Questions:**
- "If you could fix this, how would that change things for your team?"
- "What would it mean for you personally if this was solved?"
- "How much time would your team save if [X] was automated / streamlined / fixed?"
- "If the [pain] was gone, what could you focus on instead?"
- "What would hitting your numbers without this bottleneck feel like?"
- "How important is it to solve this in the next 90 days?"

**Rules:**
- These questions should feel natural, not leading. Listen to how they're phrased.
- When they describe the future state with energy — that's a buying signal.
- Transition naturally: "It sounds like solving this would mean a lot. Here's how we approach that..."

## Full SPIN Sequence Example

**Product:** Sales coaching software for SMB sales teams

> **Situation:** "How does your team currently track deals — CRM, spreadsheets, calls?"

> **Problem:** "Where do you feel like follow-up falls through the cracks the most?"

> **Implication:** "If reps are dropping follow-ups on active deals, what do you think that's costing in closed-lost revenue per quarter?"

> **Need-Payoff:** "If your team had visibility into exactly where every deal was and an automated follow-up sequence — how would that change your close rate?"

By the end, they've told you: the problem is real, the cost is significant, and the solution is something they want. Now you pitch.

## When to Use Each Stage

| Stage | When |
|-------|------|
| Situation | Opening of a discovery call — set context |
| Problem | First 5-10 min — find the pain |
| Implication | When pain is acknowledged — make it urgent |
| Need-Payoff | Once urgency exists — build desire for solution |

---

## SPIN Mistakes to Avoid

- Skipping straight to need-payoff before establishing pain (they won't care)
- Over-asking situation questions (you'll seem unprepared)
- Answering your own implication questions (let them feel it)
- Moving to pitch before completing need-payoff (kills momentum)
