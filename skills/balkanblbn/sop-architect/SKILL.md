# SOP Architect

Turn any complex task into a repeatable manual. 

## Workflow

1. **Input Task**: Describe the goal (e.g., "Monthly SEO Audit").
2. **Deconstruct**: Identify required tools, access levels, and prerequisites.
3. **Step-by-Step**: Generate 5-10 specific, numbered steps.
4. **Failure Modes**: Document what to do when things go wrong at each step.

## Output Format
SOPs are saved to `SOPs/<task-name>.md`.

## Benefits
- Reduces agent errors.
- Makes results consistent across different sessions.
- Easy to hand off to human team members.

## Installation
```bash
clawhub install sop-architect
```
