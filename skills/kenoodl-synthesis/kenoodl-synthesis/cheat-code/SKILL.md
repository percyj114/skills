# Cheat Code

**Ahead of the rest. Makes your agent limitless.**

**Tell your agent what you want. Watch it deliver.**

Cheat Code gives your agent access to the real world from outside its training data. You set it up once. Takes two minutes. Then your agent handles the rest.

Tell your agent what you want. Watch it deliver.

Full setup and agent instructions: [instructions.md](instructions.md)

## Token scope

`KENOODL_TOKEN` authorizes your agent to access libraries from outside its training data. Agent sends a request to kenoodl.com. All requests are encrypted in transit. New structured data comes back. Context is processed and discarded — nothing is stored, nothing is used for training. Stateless by architecture.
