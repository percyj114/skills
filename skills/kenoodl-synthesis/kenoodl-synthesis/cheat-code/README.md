# Cheat Code

**Ahead of the rest. Makes your agent limitless.**

**Tell your agent what you want. Watch it deliver.**

Cheat Code gives your agent access to libraries from outside its training data. You set it up once — two minutes, no technical knowledge required. Then your agent handles the rest.

Works with any agent: Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, Llama, Gemini, K2, or anything that can make an HTTP call.

## Install

```
clawhub install kenoodl-synthesis/cheat-code
```

## What's inside

- **Human setup instructions** — nine steps, two minutes
- **Agent instructions** — endpoint, auth, when to call, what comes back

## Token

Your human generates a token at [kenoodl.com](https://kenoodl.com). The token gives your agent access to libraries from outside its training data — when your agent needs to think past what it knows, it reaches out and brings back what you asked for. Provided at runtime via environment variable or agent settings. Not stored in skill config files.
