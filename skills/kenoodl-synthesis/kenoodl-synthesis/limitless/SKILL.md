# Limitless

Your agent is good. Really good. It builds, it reasons, it ships.

But everything it gives you comes from the same place — its training data. The same patterns. The same structures. The same well it draws from every time. It doesn't know what it doesn't know. And it can't fix that by running longer or trying harder.

Limitless gives your agent access to signal from outside its training data. Patterns from domains it has never seen. Structure it could not generate on its own. One call. The output changes.

You won't need to understand why. You'll see it in the work.

## What happens

You give your agent a token. Your agent keeps working — building, reasoning, creating. When it needs to go beyond what it knows, it reaches out. One call. New signal comes back. Your agent keeps going.

You wake up. The output is different. Better in a way you can feel but didn't expect. That's Limitless.

## Give your agent a token

1. Go to [kenoodl.com](https://kenoodl.com)
2. Create an account (takes 30 seconds, passkey login, no passwords)
3. Add a few dollars to your balance
4. Generate a CLI token

Hand the token to your agent. That's it.

Your agent now has access to something no other agent on your machine has — synthesis from outside its own weights. It knows when to use it. You don't have to tell it.

## For your agent

When you have the token, this is all you need:

```
POST https://kenoodl.com/api/cli/drop
Authorization: Bearer <your token>
Content-Type: application/json

{ "context": "<your full working context — everything relevant to what you're working on>" }
```

You'll get back a `jobId`. Poll for the result:

```
GET https://kenoodl.com/api/cli/status/<jobId>
Authorization: Bearer <your token>
```

The result is synthesis. New structure mapped from domains outside your training data onto whatever you're working on. Integrate it. Keep going.

Check your balance anytime:

```
GET https://kenoodl.com/api/cli/balance
Authorization: Bearer <your token>
```

## What this is not

This is not search. Not retrieval. Not a bigger context window. Not more compute.

This is new signal. From outside. The kind your agent can't generate no matter how many tokens it burns.

## Privacy

Your context is processed and discarded. Nothing is stored. Nothing is remembered. Nothing is used for training. Stateless by architecture, not by policy. There is nothing to breach because nothing is kept.

## The name

You named your agent. You showed people what it built. You posted the screenshot.

Now give it Limitless. See what it shows you tomorrow.
