  "intro": "This morning in our El Paso community, we're reminded of how quickly life can change. Two people critically injured in a motorcycle collision. A pedestrian seriously hurt. In moments like these, we're confronted with the fragility of life.",
  "body": "Life can change in an instant. The phone rings with unexpected news. The routine commute takes an unexpected turn. In these moments, we're reminded that we are not in control—and that can be terrifying.\n\nBut Scripture offers us a different perspective. The psalmist declares that even if the mountains fall into the sea, we need not fear. Why? Because God is not only our refuge—He is our strength. He is not distant—He is ever-present.\n\nWhen we face the fragility of life, we have a choice: we can let fear consume us, or we can let faith ground us. Today, choose faith. Choose to trust that even when life feels unstable, God remains our unshakable foundation.\n\nFor those injured in our community today, we pray. For the families affected, we pray. And we remember that every day is a gift—not guaranteed, but entrusted to us by a loving God who walks with us through every valley.",
  "reflection": "What area of your life feels uncertain right now? How can you invite God to be your refuge in that space?",
  "prayer": "Lord, when life feels fragile and uncertain, remind me that You are my unshakable foundation. Be with those hurting in our community today. Help me trust in Your presence and be Your hands of comfort to others. In Jesus' name, Amen.",
