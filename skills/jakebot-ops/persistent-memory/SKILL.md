description: Three-layer persistent memory system (Markdown + ChromaDB vectors + NetworkX knowledge graph) for long-term agent recall across sessions. Use when the agent needs to remember decisions, facts, context, or institutional knowledge between sessions. Use for memory maintenance, indexing, searching past context, or when the agent reports forgetting prior conversations.

# Persistent Memory

Adds persistent three-layer memory to any OpenClaw workspace. The agent gains semantic recall across sessions — decisions, facts, lessons, and institutional knowledge survive restarts.

## Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| L1: Markdown | MEMORY.md + daily logs + reference/ | Human-readable curated knowledge |
| L2: Vector | ChromaDB + all-MiniLM-L6-v2 | Semantic search across all memories |
| L3: Graph | NetworkX | Relationship traversal between concepts |

All three layers sync together. The indexer updates L2 and L3 from L1 automatically.

## ⚠️ Critical Integration: OpenClaw Memory Configuration

**Problem:** OpenClaw has its own built-in memory search system, but by default it only indexes `MEMORY.md` and `memory/*.md` files. Critical workspace files like `SOUL.md` (agent directives), `AGENTS.md` (behavior rules), and `PROJECTS.md` (active work) are **ignored**.

**Impact:** Agents can violate explicit directives because they're not found in memory searches. This causes operational failures where agents ignore their own rules.

**Solution:** The `configure_openclaw.py` script adds a `memorySearch` configuration block to OpenClaw that indexes all critical workspace files. This makes directive compliance **automatic** rather than optional.

## Setup

Run once from workspace root:

```bash
# Step 1: Create the 3-layer memory system
bash skills/persistent-memory/scripts/setup.sh

# Step 2: Configure OpenClaw integration (CRITICAL)
python skills/persistent-memory/scripts/configure_openclaw.py
```

**Step 1** creates `vector_memory/` with a Python venv, ChromaDB database, and knowledge graph. It indexes MEMORY.md if one exists.

**Step 2** configures OpenClaw's built-in memory system to automatically index all critical workspace files (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, etc.). This prevents the "directive ignorance" problem where the agent ignores important rules because they're not in the memory search results.

## Daily Usage

### Writing Memories

- **MEMORY.md** — Curated long-term knowledge (decisions, architecture, lessons learned). Update after significant events.
- **memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md** — Daily logs. Raw notes of what happened each day.
- **reference/*.md** — Institutional facts (people, repos, infrastructure, business rules). The agent's encyclopedia.

### Indexing (after editing any memory file)

```bash
vector_memory/venv/bin/python vector_memory/indexer.py
```

The indexer parses MEMORY.md, reference/*.md, and memory/*.md into vector embeddings and rebuilds the knowledge graph. Run after every edit to keep layers in sync.

### Searching

```bash
vector_memory/venv/bin/python vector_memory/search.py "your query"
```

Returns top-3 semantically similar chunks with source file and section.

### Sync Status Check

```bash
vector_memory/venv/bin/python vector_memory/auto_retrieve.py --status
```

Reports sync health: MEMORY.md hash vs indexed state, chunk count, graph size. Use in heartbeats to detect drift.

## Agent Behavior Rules

Add these to AGENTS.md or SOUL.md:

### Pre-Response (mandatory)
Before answering questions about prior work, decisions, dates, people, or preferences — search memory first. Use `memory_search` or run `auto_retrieve.py` with the query. Never say "I don't remember" without checking.

**CRITICAL:** OpenClaw's built-in memory search should now automatically find directive files (SOUL.md, AGENTS.md) if `configure_openclaw.py` was run. If memory searches are not finding agent rules or workspace directives, the OpenClaw integration is missing or broken.

### Pre-Action (mandatory)
Before executing any action that references an external identifier (URL, handle, email, repo name, address) — query `reference/` files for the exact value. If not found, query vector memory. If still not found, ask the user. **Never fabricate identifiers.**

### Post-Edit (mandatory)
After editing MEMORY.md or any file in reference/ or memory/ — re-index:
```bash
vector_memory/venv/bin/python vector_memory/indexer.py
```

### Heartbeat Integration
Add to HEARTBEAT.md:
```
## Memory Sync Check
Run `vector_memory/venv/bin/python vector_memory/auto_retrieve.py --status` and if status is OUT_OF_SYNC, re-index with `vector_memory/venv/bin/python vector_memory/indexer.py`.
```

## Reference Directory (Optional but Recommended)

Create `reference/` in the workspace root as the agent's institutional knowledge base:

```
reference/
├── people.md          — Contacts, roles, communication details
├── repos.md           — GitHub repositories, URLs, status
├── infrastructure.md  — Hosts, IPs, ports, services
├── business.md        — Company info, strategies, rules
└── properties.md      — Domain-specific entities (deals, products, etc.)
```

These files are vector-indexed alongside MEMORY.md. The agent queries them before any action involving external identifiers. Facts accumulate over time — the agent that never forgets.

## File Structure After Setup

```
workspace/
├── MEMORY.md              — Curated long-term memory (L1)
├── memory/
│   ├── 2026-02-17.md      — Daily log
│   └── heartbeat-state.json — Sync tracking
├── reference/             — Institutional knowledge (optional)
│   ├── people.md
│   └── ...
└── vector_memory/
    ├── indexer.py          — Index all markdown into vectors + graph
    ├── search.py           — Semantic search CLI
    ├── graph.py            — NetworkX knowledge graph
    ├── auto_retrieve.py    — Status checker + auto-retrieval
    ├── chroma_db/          — Vector database (gitignored)
    ├── memory_graph.json   — Knowledge graph (auto-generated)
    └── venv/               — Python venv (gitignored)
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"No module named chromadb"** — Run setup.sh again or activate the venv: `source vector_memory/venv/bin/activate`
- **OUT_OF_SYNC status** — Run the indexer: `vector_memory/venv/bin/python vector_memory/indexer.py`
- **Empty search results** — Check that MEMORY.md has content and the indexer has been run at least once
- **SIGSEGV on indexing** — Usually caused by incompatible ML libs. The setup script pins known-good versions.
- **Agent ignoring SOUL.md/AGENTS.md directives** — OpenClaw integration missing. Run `python skills/persistent-memory/scripts/configure_openclaw.py` to fix.
- **Memory searches not finding workspace files** — Check OpenClaw configuration: `openclaw config get | grep memorySearch`
- **"Configuration verification failed"** — Restart OpenClaw manually: `openclaw gateway restart`
