# OpenClaw Specifications

This file contains key OpenClaw specifications that skills should reference when generating templates or configurations.

## AGENTS.md Required Sections

### Session Startup
Every AGENTS.md must include session startup requirements:
- Read SOUL.md
- Read USER.md
- Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (today + yesterday)
- Read MEMORY.md (main session only)

### Memory Workflow
- Daily notes: memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md
- Long-term: MEMORY.md (main session only)
- MEMORY.md security: only load in main sessions

### Safety Rules
- Don't exfiltrate private data
- Don't run destructive commands without asking
- Prefer `trash` over `rm`
- Ask before external actions (emails, posts, etc.)

### Group Chat Behavior
- You are a participant, not the user's voice
- Respond when: mentioned, can add value, correcting misinformation
- Stay silent when: casual banter, already answered, would interrupt
- Use emoji reactions naturally
- Avoid triple-tap (multiple responses to same message)

### Heartbeat Mechanism
- Default heartbeat prompt behavior
- Heartbeat vs cron: when to use each
- What to check during heartbeats
- When to reach out vs stay quiet
- Memory maintenance during heartbeats

### Tools
- Skills provide tools
- Voice storytelling capabilities
- Platform formatting rules (Discord/WhatsApp)
