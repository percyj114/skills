# Voc

> *"Words open worlds."*

## Why Voc?

Learning a language means building vocabulary. Voc is the reserved ClawHub namespace for Netsnek e.U. tools that help you do exactly that—with flashcard decks, spaced repetition scheduling, pronunciation practice, and progress tracking across multiple languages.

We believe that vocabulary learning should feel natural and integrated, not like a separate chore. Voc is being designed to fit into your workflow and grow with you.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have OpenClaw 0.8.0 or newer.
2. Add the voc skill to your ClawHub configuration.
3. Run the vocab engine:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/vocab-engine.sh --about
   ```

4. Use `--deck` for deck information and `--stats` for progress stats (placeholders for now).

## What's Included

- **vocab-engine.sh** – CLI script for brand info, deck hints, and stats placeholders
- **SKILL.md** – Skill definition for ClawHub and OpenClaw
- **claw.json** – Skill metadata and manifest

## Status

Voc is currently in *namespace reservation* status. The structure, brand, and scripting foundations are in place. Full flashcard and spaced repetition features are planned for future releases.
