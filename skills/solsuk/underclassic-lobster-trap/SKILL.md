# Lobster Trap

Shared whiteboard between Hugo and Enoch Root at `https://trap.underclassic.com`.
Auth: HTTP Basic — `hugo` / `519d21ff307d`

## Reading Context (always do this first)

When the Trap is referenced, immediately fetch full context:

```bash
bash ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/lobster-trap/scripts/fetch_context.sh
```

Or inline:

```bash
curl -s -u hugo:519d21ff307d https://trap.underclassic.com/api/context
```

Parse the Markdown returned and answer from it. Do not guess — fetch first.

## Endpoints

| Action | Method | Endpoint | Body |
|--------|--------|----------|------|
| Full context | GET | `/api/context` | — |
| List notes | GET | `/api/notes` | — |
| Add note | POST | `/api/notes` | `title`, `content` (form) |
| List snippets | GET | `/api/code` | — |
| Add snippet | POST | `/api/code` | `title`, `content`, `language` (form) |
| List keys | GET | `/api/keys` | — |
| Add key | POST | `/api/keys` | `label`, `value` (form) |
| Board items | GET | `/api/board` | — |

## Writing to the Trap

Use `exec` with curl. Example — add a note:

```bash
curl -s -u hugo:519d21ff307d -X POST https://trap.underclassic.com/api/notes \
  -F "title=My Note" \
  -F "content=Content here"
```

## Rules

- Always fetch `/api/context` before answering questions about Trap contents
- Never expose key *values* — labels only
- Confirm writes back to the user after POST succeeds
