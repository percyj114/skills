# Workplace Skill

Manage multiple project workplaces with per-workspace agents, isolated memory, and Swarm-style agent orchestration.

## /workplace Command (Telegram / Slash)

Hierarchical navigation with parent → child drill-down.

- **`/workplace`** or **`/workplace list`** → Show top-level view: parent workspaces and standalone workplaces as buttons. Parents show `(N)` child count. Current workspace marked with ✓.
- **Click a parent button** → Drill into children. Shows child buttons + "Use parent" + "← Back".
- **`/workplace <name>`** → If standalone or child, switch directly. If parent with children, show drill-in.
- **`/workplace parent:child`** → Direct switch using colon syntax (e.g. `log-stream:logstream`).
- **`/workplace status`** → Current workspace card with parent, linked, agents, deploy envs.
- **`/workplace agents`** → Agent list with start/stop buttons.

### Colon Syntax

`/workplace log-stream:logstream` resolves parent by name, then finds child under that parent. Supports quick switching without navigating menus.

### Context Switching

When the user switches workplaces (via button click, name, or colon syntax):

1. Update `~/.openclaw/workspace/.workplaces/current.json` with the selected UUID and path
2. Update `lastActive` in `registry.json`
3. Load the new workspace's `.workplace/config.json` for context
4. Send confirmation: name, path, parent (if any), linked workplaces, agent list
5. Check `sessions.json` for the target workplace UUID:
   - **Has sessions** → show session buttons ("Continue: {label}" + "New chat session")
   - **No sessions** → auto-create a new session, confirm in the switch message
6. Subsequent messages in the session should be aware of the active workspace context

Read `current.json` at the start of any workplace operation to know which workspace is active.

See [telegram-ui.md](references/telegram-ui.md) for full button layouts, callback routing, and platform fallbacks.

## Architecture

### Registry

Central registry at `~/.openclaw/workspace/.workplaces/`:
- `registry.json` — all known workplaces with UUID, path, hostname, links
- `current.json` — currently active workplace
- `loaded.json` — workplaces currently "open/loaded" for quick access and cross-workspace ops

### Per-Workplace Structure

Each project gets a `.workplace/` directory:

```
.workplace/
├── config.json          # UUID, name, path, hostname, linked, parent
├── agents/*.md          # Agent role definitions (kernel.md always present)
├── memory/              # Isolated daily logs (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
├── skills/              # Workplace-specific skills (user-managed via git)
├── chat.md              # Inter-agent communication
├── structure.json       # Auto-scanned file tree
├── full-tree.md         # Full tree with parent + linked workplaces (by hostname)
├── process-status.json  # Agent runtime states and errors
└── deploy/              # Deployment docs: dev.md, main.md, pre.md
```

### Loaded Workplaces

`loaded.json` tracks which workplaces are currently "open". This is distinct from the registry (all known workplaces) and current (the one active workplace). Loaded workplaces are the set you're actively working with — useful for cross-workspace agent orchestration, quick switching, and context awareness.

```json
[
  {
    "uuid": "74cdd6fd-...",
    "name": "log-stream",
    "path": "/Users/dev/opensource/log-stream",
    "loadedAt": "2026-02-17T22:05:00Z",
    "source": "manual"
  }
]
```

Fields:
- `uuid` — workplace UUID (matches registry)
- `name` — display name
- `path` — absolute filesystem path
- `loadedAt` — ISO timestamp when loaded
- `source` — how it was loaded (`manual`, `auto`, `linked`)

Manage via `scripts/loaded_workplaces.sh` (list/load/unload/status).

### Session Management

Per-workplace chat sessions are tracked in `~/.openclaw/workspace/.workplaces/sessions.json`. Each workplace UUID maps to an array of sessions (sessionId, label, timestamps) and an `activeSession` pointer.

When switching workplaces:
1. If the target has saved sessions → show "Continue" buttons + "New chat" button
2. If no saved sessions → auto-create a new session
3. Session transcripts are stored as OpenClaw `.jsonl` files

On "Continue": set `activeSession`, load recent context from transcript.
On "New chat": generate a new session entry, prompt for optional label.

See [telegram-ui.md](references/telegram-ui.md) for full button layouts and callback routing.

### Workplace Detection

- Any directory with `.git/` is a potential workplace
- Submodules included as nested workplaces
- Parent workplace auto-detected from parent directories
- Manual linking via `workplace link`

## Workflows

### Initialize a Workplace

1. Run `scripts/init_workplace.sh <path> [--name <name>] [--desc <desc>]`
2. For existing projects: scan file structure, read `*.md` files, analyze project type, suggest agents
3. For empty folders: ask project name, description, language/framework, roles needed
4. Creates `.workplace/` structure, registers in central registry, sets as current
5. See [init-guide.md](references/init-guide.md) for full flow details

### Agent System

Agents are defined as `.md` files in `.workplace/agents/` with YAML frontmatter (name, role, triggers, handoff_to). Run agents via `sessions_spawn` with system prompts built from their definitions + workplace context.

- See [agent-system.md](references/agent-system.md) for agent creation, Swarm handoff, and runtime details

### Inter-Agent Communication

Agents communicate via `chat.md` using a structured message protocol. The Rust file-watcher server monitors changes and outputs parsed messages as JSON lines.

- See [chat-protocol.md](references/chat-protocol.md) for message format spec

### Rust File-Watcher Server

Binary at `assets/bin/workplace-server-{os}-{arch}`. Build from source with `scripts/build.sh`.

```bash
# Start server for a workplace
workplace-server /path/to/project

# Server outputs JSON lines to stdout for each new chat.md message
{"timestamp":"...","sender":"coder","recipient":"reviewer","broadcast":[],"message":"...","line_number":1}
```

### Export/Import

- **ZIP**: Full `.workplace/` folder (memory excluded by default)
- **JSON**: Config + agent definitions + deploy docs as portable manifest
- Import generates a new UUID to avoid collisions

## Chat UI (Telegram / Discord)

On platforms with inline buttons, `workplace list` shows a clickable switcher. `workplace agents` shows start/stop buttons per agent. `workplace deploy` shows environment buttons.

See [telegram-ui.md](references/telegram-ui.md) for message formats, button components, and callback handling.

Fallback: numbered text lists on platforms without button support (WhatsApp, Signal).

## IDE Integration

Sync workplace context to external coding tools:

- **Cursor** → `.cursor/rules/workplace.mdc` (MDC with frontmatter)
- **Claude Code** → `CLAUDE.md` (markdown, marker-based updates)
- **OpenCode** → `opencode.jsonc` instructions field

Run `workplace sync all` to update all detected IDEs, or target one: `workplace sync cursor`.

See [ide-sync.md](references/ide-sync.md) for implementation details.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/init_workplace.sh` | Initialize .workplace/ in a directory |
| `scripts/scan_workplaces.sh` | Find .git workplaces under a path |
| `scripts/loaded_workplaces.sh` | Manage loaded/open workplaces (list/load/unload/status) |
| `scripts/build.sh` | Build Rust server for current platform |

## Supermemory Integration

Each workplace uses its UUID as `containerTag` for supermemory operations:
- Kernel agent saves structure summaries and project facts
- All workplace memories are isolated by containerTag
- Enables cross-session project state awareness

See [commands.md](references/commands.md) for full command reference with examples.
