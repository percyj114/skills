## What It Does

**Content Audits** — Systematically analyze your existing content across all platforms. Score each piece on reach, engagement, conversion, evergreen value, and SEO strength. Identify gaps in topics, formats, funnel stages, and platforms. Get a prioritized 30-day action plan.

**Audience Personas** — Build behavioral profiles of your target audience that go beyond demographics. Map their information diet, sharing triggers, purchase triggers, and content preferences. Inform every piece of content with real audience understanding.

**Topic Ideation** — Generate content topics backed by demand signals, not brainstorming. Five methods: keyword-first research, competitor content mining, trend surfing, problem-solution mapping, and content remixing. Each topic scored on a 25-point matrix.

**Content Calendars** — Full editorial calendars with specific dates, times, platforms, formats, topics, target keywords, and CTAs. Weekly and monthly structures with platform-optimized posting times. Ready to execute immediately.

**Platform-Specific Writing** — Drafts tailored to each platform's rules and audience expectations. Twitter threads with scroll-stopping hooks. Blog posts structured for SEO. LinkedIn posts that drive comments. Newsletter issues that get forwarded. Reddit posts that respect community norms.

**SEO Optimization** — On-page SEO checklists, content structure templates, keyword research methods (no paid tools required), and content freshness strategies. Make every piece of content work for search engines without sacrificing readability.

**Headline Formulas** — Seven proven headline formulas with fill-in-the-blank templates. Six hook patterns for opening lines. A/B testing framework for systematically finding what works with your audience.

**Content Repurposing** — Transform one piece of content into 10+ pieces across 7 platforms. The repurposing cascade, staggered release timelines, and the reverse repurposing strategy for scaling viral hits.

**Engagement Optimization** — Track the metrics that matter (not vanity metrics). Monthly optimization cycles. The content flywheel that compounds learning over time.

**A/B Testing** — Structured testing protocol for headlines, hooks, CTAs, formats, and posting times. Works for email (native A/B) and social (manual method). Documentation framework for building a content playbook.
