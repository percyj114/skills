# Changelog

## v1.4.2 — 2026-02-18

- **Step 11: parameter extraction from skill.yml** — `--slug`, `--name`, `--version` are now
  extracted directly from skill.yml before publish. Guards against wrong/guessed display names.
  Fails loudly if `display_name` is missing.
- **Step 11.5: post-publish verification** — after every publish, `clawhub inspect` is run and
  output compared against skill.yml (name, version, description, owner). Mismatch → fix and
  republish before proceeding to security scan or delivery.
- **Step 1.5: `display_name` field required** — added to scaffolding and version-bump checklist.
  Title case, plain English, must be set explicitly in skill.yml.
- Fixes root cause of "Skill Release Task Runner" wrong title incident (2026-02-18).
