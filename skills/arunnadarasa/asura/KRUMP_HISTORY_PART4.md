# KRUMP HISTORY AND FUNDAMENTALS - PART 4

**Disclaimer: This information is based on knowledge available up to 2017 and may not reflect the most current developments in Krump culture. Some information may be inconsistent or outdated.**

## Movement Zones

Buck is lower zone (pelvis, chest and shoulders at the same time), small movements, you can groove, it has more depth.

Krump is middle zone, before you can go into buck zone, take off something from your shoulders – use small stories.

Live is upper zone with big moves using your hands.

### Communication Through Movement

Talking is the language of Krump, how you switch your hands is how you switch your get off – fist is for more power, it determine your get off, learn how to watch your hands when you SWITCH.

Open hands is to emphasise larger movements in big motion, the relationship is between your eyes and your hands – you need to be able to watch yourself = hands work.

Your character tell your story:
● Big Get Off/Travelling/Groove = open hands
● Power Get Off/Travelling/Groove = closed hands
● Style Travelling = talking hands
● Talking hands helps people understands your style

Simple things become big problems when you understand the advantages of it.

Flex and release is the key, do not hold.

You switch your get off by your wrist, the stomp can be the cue for your switch.

When your mind is racing, that's when it becomes hard – you need to travel in different level, material come and go but the feeling of Krump remains.

Your get off is way more important than crazy hat tricks – in a battle, what you choose to use, if you make a mistake, you will lose = if you choose to take a risk like that such as hat tricks, if you drop the hat after a build up, you drop the atmosphere but your Krump still exists (if you cannot fill your Krump, that's a problem).

### Hype Culture

Back then, Eyez used to be the only one to wear cap, everybody else were getting raw like Enforcer, this is real Krump – the only way you can get involved in a battle or a session is with your hype = hype is NOT for you, sacrifice it for your family dancing, it's for that person, hype is designed to feed the person that's dancing to get them to the level they want to be so if you don't hype them, you are taking away from their Krump.

Hype is what separate us from every other movement, if you can in a circle and what you do is not accepted, you are being drained so you are killing Krump by holding your hype because you are being selfish – Krump is never selfish, Eyez and Mijo always shared, they shared every piece of energy, that's how they evolved in this form.

Everybody owes people hype, they are giving you what they have – everybody takes their turn, that's why we all session – think of it that's where extreme hype lives and you are trying to figure out what to do with it.

Without hype, Krump doesn't exist – that's why Eyez used to get off on people who didn't hype = that's where "pack out" started coming – you have to separate trash talk from the dance.

Veterans are more than just battle, they teach workshop, organise session, spread information, making fams, people should be speaking you in your city – those who have been consistent in their krump over a long period of time, pushing krump outside the session = there are new veterans made all the time in your place, everybody builds different – do people know you, know your work and not just you talking.

There are session dancers and battle dancers like Enforcer and Tight Eyez respectively.

### Judging Criteria

Eyez judge in 7 criteria – Kill Off, Material, Combo, Travelling, Musicality, Get Off and Basics.

Somebody who doesn't have material is likely to not have combos, timing is also important – you have to know what you use = battle strategies, you cant use everything in one time.

Storytelling is finding the drag points within the story – finding one sentence and making it long = then I, then I, then I – in the lab, that's when you determine what you are going to do.

## Fam System and Rankings

Styles of Krump:
● RAW: Only basics moves are used in a powerful manner
● GOOFY: Pioneered by the Krump practitioner "Goofy" himself. It is the least aggressive of the Krump styles, usually funny and energetic
● RUGGED: Containing fewer tricks; more of a pure essence
● BEASTY: Aggressive, beast-like and powerful. It is similar to bully but more animalistic
● GRIMEY: Dirty, mistreating and "wrong"
● FLASHY: Using a lot of foot movement and quick sharp, precise and showy moves

● JERKY: Using motions that are not smooth and flowing but still artistic
● BULLY: Aggressive and powerful
● TRICKS: Using a combination of moves
● FAST: Quick, fast and energetic movements
● TECHNICAL: A mix of flashy and smooth. It's more of a crowd pleasing style
● GULLY: Created by B-Dash, you are not scared of anybody

### How the Fam System Works

When someone starts Krump for the first time, they work on their basics (chest pops, stomps and jabs). Then stamina is another area of training since dancing for one minutes takes lots of training. Once they feel confident on their foundations, they then try to find a character which they can relate from their real life to express their story as a medium.

It can be any character such as Hectik, Majin Buu and Sabertooth. This become their Krump name, if they find someone else with a similar style which can be developed further, they can have him/her under their wings to become their mentor ("Big Homie"). For examples, "Big Hectik" takes someone under him as "Baby Hectik". Following months of training, if he feels that his "Lil Homie" is ready to move on a rank, he/she then becomes "Junior Hectik". Someone can have more than name such "Hectik aka Terror" to describe different characters which correspond to different styles of Krump.

● Twin

If it is often common for high level Krumpers to have 2 or more big homies such as "Liveness aka Twinn Wave aka Twin Stretch" and "Miss Chief aka Princess Ugly Fate aka Girl X Poundz aka Lady B.A.D".
