**Disclaimer: This information is based on knowledge available up to 2017 and may not reflect the most current developments in Krump culture. Some information may be inconsistent or outdated.**

## Character Development

Character is what changed Krump forever. Eyez used to wear a cap so that the opponent couldn't see his face to dominate him as he was young back then, it wasn't to look cool – he used to look down the whole time = he bought a cap that was too large so it covered his eyes.

Eyez battled the best clown dancer where many people started clown dancing with him and another clown dancer as inspiration – this was the first battle for Tight Eyez and Big Mijo, this is where his reputation grow up from.

Eyez didn't know how to use a locker so he carried 5 books in his backpack and people thought that it was part of his character – It was Eyez, Mijo and his friend called "Fish" who was hyping the battle against the 2 clown dancers.

When Eyez was winning, Big Mijo started to hype him and that's where "hype" came from = when Mijo stated that Eyez won, the hype from him and 5 other people from the streets enabled Eyez to become "Live" for the 1st time and after he finished off his "Spazz", that's he felt comfortable to lift his cap off to look at people – its as if he grown up.

The clown dancer just walked off and Eyez looked at him leave, this is where his reputation came from and his mother (Mama Eyez) called him "Tight Eyez" and said he shouldn't have any other name because his eyes were small.

Eyez and Mijo joined a clown group and this is where they started to do "tag moves" and "army moves" - invisible props and interactions came in afterwards = Mijo would shoot at Eyez who would then act he was shoot, he would blow on Eyez tee where he would act as being blown away – Eyez then mimicked Mijo moves which lead to the creation of invisible props.

"Cartoonz" was the first Krump crew, it used to be called "Cartoonz Family/Clowns" and was changed to "Cartoonz Fam" = this is where the Krump fam came from.

They used to have names taken from Cartoonz but Eyez and Mijo declined to take on new names so this is where family of characters came from – Mijo started to build the "Street Bully" character where he would get physical and scare people whereas Eyez used to stare at people = this is where the physical contact came from.

Double role is made Krump characters stands out much more and peoples started to take on inspirations from super heroes, video games – that's where character came in.

When you do a move with a character plus a meaning, that's when you have a story – if you don't have a character, you miss a major thing in Krump = this is somebody you can be outside of your normal self.

Eyez used to be shy but when he krump, he is not shy anymore – he does get nervous but definitely not shy, he would get off anytime = he would have an assassin type of look in his eyes, its his real character.

He has different characters because he feels different ways when he is dancing – by being the top krumper, many people were after him so to repel their hostility, he created the Bad Guy character for combat where he expect to be hated, if you don't hate him, he will give you a reason for it.

The NY Madness came from his roots as he is from New York and the materials he did in his room didn't have a meaning.

Style Ripper is when he would take other peoples material and make it better.

Machine was given by his brother as Eyez had internal bleeding but still went full on at the session and he said "something is wrong with you, you're a machine".

Baby C was the 1st lil homie of Tight Eyez and Big Mijo.

Then after Little Mijo came (the 2nd lil homie), he is currently Chris Brown right hand man for music.

Baby Tight Eyez as the 3rd lil homie who is known as TeeFlii (rapper).

Krump help people beyond the dance.

Lil C brought the cocky element in Krump (overconfident), Miss Prissy was the girl tomboy.

Tight Eyez, Big Mijo, Lil C and Miss Prissy came up with the name of Krump – Lil C suggested "Crank", another said "Stomp" then "Stomped", after hours Eyez suggested "Crump" with the letter C which sounded similar to crumb, then they thought of using a different letter like K and "Krump" came up where everybody agreed with the name.

The acronym from Krump came from Eye journey.

Clown started to Krump where face-paint came from, it was either "Get Clown" or "Get Krump" where they grew more serious about the dance and the split happened – the documentary "Rize". Eyez and Mijo taught Lil C and Miss Prissy.

Eyez was raised by his grandmother who brought him to church which started at 6am – Preaching helped his Krump, the more he went to church, the stronger his Krump got, his dance level started to go higher at a very fast rate.

His spirituality enabled him to change people live just by them watching him and told about it when he was 17.

He started dancing for the girls and went to ballet to flirt for fun but he started to get good at it – almost everything happened unexpectedly, he started to receive letters from oversea people who were inspired by him like. This is when he decided to do 7 DVDs in a row, he wasn't doing it for his local community but for the oversea community to help them grow.

Spirituality grew the movement and also caused him to beef with people, dance came from god, everything came from god – he started to read the bible, if he dance, he would preach.

When you get "live", you feel a pull up, that's what make you "live" - an upper pull, he feels uplifted = it's the strongest dance ever.

He would say that they would become the best Christians dance group ever, that was his main goal – fam everywhere, brotherhood = family for those who don't have a family, if the fam members who got trained became "live", they may find god and this was the main motive behind Krump fam where session was the place to get this feeling.

New Zealand Eyez dislike to judge events but he understand it's his job, he is not the tournament person.

Krump can give you an identity, if you don't how to hype, you don't know how to Krump, if you do give, you will get it back that's like a spiritual law – that's why he hypes people like crazy.

You cannot perfect the feeling of Krump but you can perfect the movements – you will be different every time you dance = you can feel good or you may not feel good.

Find 3 words to act out with your arms and do it forever, just different words on top of words, 3 words to help you act = it's your job to interpret your story.
