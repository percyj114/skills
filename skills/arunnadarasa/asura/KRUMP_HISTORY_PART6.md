**Disclaimer: This information is based on knowledge available up to 2017 and may not reflect the most current developments in Krump culture. Some information may be inconsistent or outdated.**

## Music, Crews, and Events

### Krump Music

Krump music is mainly made with Drums (Kick, Snare & Hats), 808 Bassline, Hype (Acapella), 140 bpm and rugged melody. Then there are many variations from different beatmakers. Some of them have lyrics and others just instrumental. The tempo is fast since Krump is highly energetic. There are new genres including:

● Krumpstep - Krump beats mixed with Dubstep
● ElectroKrump – Pioneered by Morf
● KrumpRock – Pioneered by Playa
● Gaana Krump – Pioneered by Twin RGHXK

Since many beatmakers developed their skills from scratch, they don't have an official website to post their music. Thus they use Souncloud, Bandcamp and occasionally iTunes to sell their albums.
