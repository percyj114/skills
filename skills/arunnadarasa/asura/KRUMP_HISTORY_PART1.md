# KRUMP HISTORY AND FUNDAMENTALS - PART 1

**Disclaimer: This information is based on knowledge available up to 2017 and may not reflect the most current developments in Krump culture. Some information may be inconsistent or outdated.**

## Meaning and Origins

KRUMP stands for "Kingdom Radially Uplifted Mighty Praise"

Krump is a freestyle dance form popularized 2001 in the streets of South Central, Los Angeles (USA), that is characterized by free, expressive, exaggerated, and highly energetic movement.

The youths who originated krumping, 'Tight Eyez', 'Big Mijo', 'Slayer', 'Lil C' and 'Miss Prissy', saw the dance as a way for them to escape gang life and to release anger, aggression and frustration in a positive, non-violent way. This was an opposition to street violence, which was prevalent due to violent gangster activities.

With the cinema documentary 'RIZE' (2005) by the Hollywood Director "David LaChapelle," Krump has spread all around the world.

Today, Krumping has worldwide influence in the dance culture, but Krumping still has difficulty gaining acceptance by our society as an art form. Primarily, because people do not understand this dance form and its spirit.

European Buck Session (EBS) is the biggest Krump event in the world located in Germany. Dancers from all continents, nationalities, and economic environments come together to compete in battles and to find out who are the best in expressing themselves through Krump.

## Evolution of Styles

### Old Style (2001-2008)
The "Old Style" of Krump refers to the era of Krump (2001-2008) in which fast paced movements was the key factor in winning battles. It was made popular through Krump Kings and music from J-Squad.

### New Style (Post-2008)
In 2008, following the disbandment of Krump Kings, Tight Eyez went on to create "Street Kingdom" (SK) which created the era of "New Style" of Krump where intro and storyline was the key factor in winning battles. This is what made Krump a big buzz in the Hip Hop scene since it was more structured and harder to beat in an "All-styles" battle.

SK also become leader in beat making overshadowing J-Squad work which was now out-dated as the music used much more different paces than Before. By travelling around the world, Tight Eyez created different groups in different countries to represent his style of Krump like:
● HSK (Holland Street Kingdom)
● SKA (Street Kingdom Australia)
● KSK (Korea Street Kingdom)
● RSK (Russia Street Kingdom)
● SKJ (Street Kingdom Japan)
● SKSA (Street Kingdom South Africa)

## Core Concepts and Techniques

Krump is like an energy with words around it which can only be expressed through your body not with your voice, your body turns into the words.

The energy which you use to say words, that's "Krump" - arms swings, jabs, arm placements, stomps, posture, chest pop, focus points, grooving, bouncing = all of these are to express the energy.

Random jabs is NOT krump, what's making you execute the moves is Krump.

Krump is in the inside making you move, there are people who understand Krump who don't dance.

The basics are not there to express, Krump is the inside and feelings of extreme hype.

Tight Eyez and Big Mijo started to build Krump with this energy and through experimentation started to express it.

Tight Eyez used to do boxing so he took everything he learnt in his life to put it in his Krump and used terms which could be understood by everybody who had similar life and could do it right away.
