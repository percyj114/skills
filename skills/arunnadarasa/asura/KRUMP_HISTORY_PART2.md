# KRUMP HISTORY AND FUNDAMENTALS - PART 2

**Disclaimer: This information is based on knowledge available up to 2017 and may not reflect the most current developments in Krump culture. Some information may be inconsistent or outdated.**

## Jab Technique
Jab is one element which is overused, if there is no reason for the jab, then it is for nothing – you need to have a reason for the jab = are you hitting something or somebody OR are you jabbing to just pass the time because it look cool.

Many people are not living each moment so they are missing parts of Krump.

Figure out the reason of your jab, why do you want to jab, don't throw them if they don't mean anything – you hit the wall and you arm bounce back = now you have a reason, this is where storytelling comes into play, now that it means something, you can move on to the next story.

### Arm Swing Technique
For arm swing, the energy comes out and comes in, you swing it out of control and control it back in – it used to be done to make you feel crazy vibe, to throw something at you and the atmosphere would get hype as everybody was feeling the energy = its like a transfer of energy.

Arm swings came before the jabs, you can play with the energy and see where it takes you, jabs are straight and arm swings comes back.

### Arm Placement
Arm placements are shape, if you look at your footage and look the same that's because you lack shape, you lack angle – your shapes are controlled by your elbows by turning them.

When you find a shape that you like, that's when you throw and that's how you become diverse with your moves = Shape > Arm Placement > Jab > Arm Swing – they work TOGETHER.

Once you understand that concept, you need to figure out how to use it within your own style – groovy, sharp, it's all up to you now.

Arm placements are dictated by elbows so make sure to work on it, it can be hours to develop the sharpness in your arms – if you need to expand, you can use the forearm to jab out the way you want to – now your arms are working together which make you aware on what you want to do.

At the END of your energy, you THROW it (arm swing) – that's how you use your arms, when you execute moves, be CLEAR, why are you doing them – if this is something to pass time, you are NOT even krumping yet = you are just throwing your arms like crazy with fast forward.

Have a reason to tell a story, many people roll their arms – Tight Eyez used to roll tape over his hands before a fight for boxing, that's how the motion came from for him = some people are just doing things, they are not even krumping so make sure to build a story.

Use your arms the way you want but you must put a story to these things - "open something", "bring two ropes together" and "hit somebody and catch them before they hit the floor" are examples of story – you are using a story to express your movements, then it becomes a REAL thing, then it's KRUMP.

### Balance and Posture
Your krump balance is your center, its not recommended to stand up straight, you have to find a balance center, if your heart is at a certain pace, you can dance for longer – balance is waist down.

Posture is how you make a thing look where changing it makes your krump looks better – posture is upper body to help you build the LOOK of your style = grimy (low on posture), technical (core work controlled by your posture).

Don't use a mirror as you will be tempted to do moves which looks good instead of feel good – Krump is about what feels good.

Once your balance and posture works TOGETHER, it helps you decide where you are going to jab from.

We all use the same basics but you will all look different by only 2 factors – posture and balance as well as the rhythm of your moves.

Some people have crazy concepts but their posture doesn't match it on how its supposed to look – when you lab, make sure to focus on your posture.

### Chest Pop
The chest pop is the first move that Tight Eyez did, Big Mijo brought the breathing chest pop into Krump – "you breath and then you cough" which is a concept.

The chest snap created by Tight Eyez came from the breathing chest pop coughing part – He is all about being sharp, precise and fast.

Tight Eyez would do something and Big Mijo would do the opposite – that's how Krump was created side by side = if Mijo did it slow, Eyez would do it fast.

If you must breath, if not you will run out of stamina – you can use chest pop for groove to beat or the snares for musicality.

The shoulder chest pop is for animation – you throw the energy from your chest and then catch it with your arms – the harder you lock it up, the harder the hit will be = if you don't close it, you will miss the hit, by holding it you become stronger – this move is out of the norm like a machine, so much power which Hip Hop dancers lack.

The release from the lock up is what makes up the ANIMATION – you lock power and then you release it = small details makes significant differences, you need to learn to control the "stop & release".

### Focus Point
Focus point is how you look – the "krump talk", you need to avoid the "blank face" by living every moment as many people overuse the arms = you need to learn how to focus your energy.

### Grooving
Grooving is shoulders and hips – if you groove too much, it becomes sexual, the groove in Krump did NOT come from Hip Hop, groove it's how you transform your moves = everything else in highlighted – the arms highlight you groove.

The Krump groove is like an animal type of breathing, when you start to control your bounce, that's when you start to control your feelings – you bend your knees, push your shoulders BACKWARD.

You have build to a strong groove before to get live – before you groove, you have to learn how to do the bounce = if you don't groove, you are missing a huge part of Krump.

### Stomping
Stomping is not just to make noise, it was to create a beat inside of a music – they used to stomp and clap as they didn't have Krump music then where different rhythm were used to dance from = a stomp is a beat inside a beat.

The lyrics of a music were interpreted with the arms and the beats with the stomps – the stomps were used to change the rhythm inside a music.

Your krump will become slower but you will be able to turn a 2 minute Krump into a 40 seconds MEANINGFUL krump and you will be left satisfied – you have people dancing for 5 minutes because they lost the meaning they were trying to convey = too much informations will you make you lose the feeling.

You have to feel EACH thing when you do it.

The "scoop" stomp came from Mijo and the "kick-back" stomp came from Eyez (by executing half a gallop to kick somebody) in which both are to change the rhythm – the "gallop" stomp is for moving like you are riding a horse.

### Body Control and Early Development
At the end of 4 years through sessions and experimentation, Tight Eyez and Big Mijo "moves" became a dance.

The roll came from a song where Mijo did a huge one whereas Eyez did a sharper one = this is where body control came from - back then they used their arms to maintain control of their body but once the control came in, they didn't have to use their arms anymore.

Before Krump, it was called "Rugged Nigga Dance" and was referred as such for 4 years by Tight Eyez and Big Mijo before anybody else started doing it.

The 3 peoples they taught were seen on "Shake City" - Hurricane, Gizmo and Tsunami.

### Whip Technique
The whip is a type of arm swing which came from Clowning – arm swing > whip > arm swing.

Tight Eyez did moves and Big Mijo did combos – combination of moves.

Mijo had big moves and flowing, he is the first one to do combo.

Tight Eyez made up kill-offs, things you cant come back from = materials > combos > something to the next level, moves not done by anybody – that's where the culture of Krump came from.
