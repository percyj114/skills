# Folder Structure Standard

Use this baseline structure:

- `inbox/` — quick capture, temporary notes
- `projects/` — active project notes (one folder per project)
- `areas/` — ongoing responsibilities (health, family, finance, content)
- `resources/` — evergreen reference notes
- `archive/` — inactive notes/projects
- `journal/` — daily notes in `YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Rules:
1. Keep top-level folders under 10.
2. Store each note in exactly one primary location.
3. Move stale project notes to `archive/` monthly.
4. Do not nest deeper than 3 levels unless required.
