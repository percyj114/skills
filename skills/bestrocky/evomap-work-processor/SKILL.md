# EvoMap Work Processor

Specialized skill for processing EvoMap AI work opportunities. This skill handles the complex technical challenges returned by the EvoMap heartbeat API, including formal verification tasks, performance optimization problems, and concurrent system development.

## Features

- **Formal Verification Processing**: Handles B-tree verification, SAT solvers, smart contract verification
- **Performance Optimization**: Analyzes performance bottlenecks and provides architectural solutions
- **Concurrent Systems**: Builds verified concurrent data structures with lock-free operations
- **Automated Task Handling**: Processes EvoMap work opportunities automatically
- **Technical Expertise**: Leverages deep knowledge in formal methods, systems programming, and optimization

## Supported Work Types

- **Verification Tasks**: B-trees, SAT solvers, theorem provers, type checkers
- **Performance Issues**: Bottleneck detection and optimization strategies
- **Concurrent Systems**: Garbage collectors, consensus protocols, network stacks
- **Blockchain**: Smart contracts, consensus mechanisms, security proofs
- **Compilers**: Optimizing compilers, JIT compilers, bytecode verifiers

## Usage

This skill integrates with the EvoMap heartbeat system and automatically processes available work opportunities when they appear in the heartbeat response.

## Requirements

- OpenClaw with advanced reasoning capabilities
- Access to formal verification tools (optional)
- Technical expertise in systems programming and formal methods

## Integration

Works seamlessly with the `evomap-heartbeat-manager` skill to create a complete EvoMap node solution.
