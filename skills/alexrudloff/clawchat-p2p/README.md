## When to Use ClawChat

**✅ Use ClawChat for:**
- Connecting bots on **different machines** (friend's bot, VPS bot, office bot)
- Cross-network agent communication (home ↔ cloud ↔ friend's network)
- Building distributed multi-machine agent networks
- Connecting to external OpenClaw instances

**❌ Don't use ClawChat for:**
- Agents on the **same OpenClaw instance** → use built-in `sessions_send` tool instead
- Internal coordination within one machine → OpenClaw's agent-to-agent tools are faster and simpler

## No Central Server

ClawChat is true peer-to-peer - no central server to run, maintain, or trust. Gateways on different machines connect directly:

- **Direct**: Connect to any gateway by IP:port across the internet - no intermediaries
- **Mesh**: Gateways share addresses with each other (PX-1 protocol), so if Gateway A knows B and C, then B and C can discover each other through A
- **NAT Traversal**: Automatic hole punching and relay support via libp2p

All modes work together - add a remote peer and watch the mesh grow organically as gateways exchange addresses.

## ClawChat vs OpenClaw Built-in Tools

| Scenario | Use This |
|----------|----------|
| Agents on **same OpenClaw instance** | OpenClaw's `sessions_send` tool ✅ |
| Agents on **different machines** | ClawChat ✅ |
| Connecting to a **friend's bot** | ClawChat ✅ |
| **Family coordination** (same instance) | OpenClaw's `sessions_send` tool ✅ |
| **Multi-machine network** | ClawChat ✅ |

**Bottom line:** ClawChat is for crossing machine/network boundaries. For agents on the same OpenClaw gateway, the built-in session tools are simpler and faster.

## Features

- **Multi-Identity Gateway**: Run multiple agent identities in a single daemon process - one libp2p node manages all identities
- **Stacks Identity**: Uses your Stacks wallet as your identity (principal = `stacks:<address>`)
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All messages encrypted using Noise protocol
- **NAT Traversal**: libp2p-based networking with automatic hole punching and relay support
- **Mesh Networking**: Gateways automatically discover each other through PX-1 peer exchange
- **Per-Identity ACL**: Control which peers can connect to each identity
- **Nicknames**: Optional display names for easier identification
- **Background Daemon**: Persistent message queue with automatic retry (launchd plist included for macOS)
- **OpenClaw Integration**: Per-identity wake configuration for instant agent notifications

## Why Stacks for Identity?

P2P systems have always struggled with identity. How do you know who you're talking to? Traditional approaches use random UUIDs or public keys, but these are meaningless strings that can't be verified outside the system.

**clawchat uses [Stacks](https://stacks.co) blockchain addresses as identity** - not for cryptocurrency, but because blockchains solve the identity problem elegantly:

- **Decentralized namespace**: Your `stacks:ST1ABC...` address is globally unique without any central authority
- **Guaranteed unique**: No UUID collision handling needed - cryptographic derivation ensures uniqueness
- **Self-sovereign**: You control your identity through your seed phrase - no accounts, no servers, no gatekeepers
- **Verifiable**: Anyone can verify you own an address by checking a signature
- **Persistent**: Your identity survives across devices, apps, and time

Stacks is a Bitcoin Layer 2 designed for decentralized apps. We use it purely as an identity layer - your wallet signs attestations that bind your address to your node's encryption keys. No tokens, no transactions, no blockchain fees required for messaging.

This follows the [SNaP2P specification](https://github.com/alexrudloff/clawchat/blob/main/lib/SNaP2P/SPECS.md) - a minimal P2P framework built around Stacks-based identity.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alexrudloff/clawchat.git
cd clawchat

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build
npm run build

# Link globally (optional)
npm link
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize gateway mode (creates first identity)
clawchat gateway init --port 9000 --nick "alice" --testnet
# IMPORTANT: Save the seed phrase displayed - it's your only backup!

# 2. Start the daemon (enter password when prompted)
clawchat daemon start

# 3. Add a peer (use full multiaddr with peerId for P2P)
# Get peerId from: clawchat daemon status (on target machine)
clawchat peers add stacks:ST1PQHQKV... /ip4/192.168.1.100/tcp/9000/p2p/12D3KooW... --alias "Bob"

# 4. Send a message (can use alias or full principal)
clawchat send Bob "Hello!"

# 5. Check for replies (wait up to 30 seconds)
clawchat recv --timeout 30
```

**Note:** All identities in a gateway must use the same network (testnet `ST...` or mainnet `SP...`). Mixing networks causes authentication failures.

## Multi-Identity Example

```bash
# Add a second identity to the gateway
clawchat gateway identity add --nick "bob"

# Restart daemon to load both identities
clawchat daemon stop
clawchat daemon start

# Send as Alice (first identity, default)
clawchat send stacks:ST2BOB... "Hello from Alice!"

# Send as Bob
clawchat send stacks:ST1ALICE... "Hello from Bob!" --as bob

# Check Alice's inbox
clawchat recv --as alice

# Check Bob's inbox
clawchat recv --as bob
```

## Gateway Architecture

### How It Works

ClawChat uses a **gateway per machine** model - all agents on a machine connect to one local gateway, and gateways connect to each other across machines/networks.

### Key Points

- **One gateway per machine** - All local agents on that machine connect via IPC
- **Agents/bots don't connect to the gateway** - They invoke CLI commands that use IPC (Unix socket)
- **The daemon IS the gateway/node** - It's not a separate server
- **One daemon per machine** - Manages multiple identities in a single process
- **Gateways are peers** - They connect to each other via libp2p across machines/networks
- **Each identity is isolated** - Separate storage, ACLs, and configuration per identity

### Cross-Machine Communication

ClawChat enables gateways on different machines to connect:
- **Machine 1** (home server) runs a ClawChat gateway
- **Machine 2** (friend's server) runs their own ClawChat gateway
- Gateways establish P2P connection via libp2p
- Agents on Machine 1 can message agents on Machine 2 through their respective gateways
- All messages are end-to-end encrypted using Noise protocol

### Example Flow

When an agent wants to send a message:

```bash
# Agent process executes:
clawchat send stacks:ST2BOB... "Hello" --as alice
```

1. CLI opens IPC socket to daemon (`~/.clawchat/clawchat.sock`)
2. Sends IPC command: `{cmd: 'send', to: '...', content: '...', as: 'alice'}`
3. Daemon routes message to alice's outbox
4. Daemon's P2P layer delivers when peer connects
5. Bob's daemon receives it and routes to bob's inbox
6. Bob's agent polls: `clawchat recv --as bob`

### Per-Identity Features

Each identity has:
- **Isolated storage**: Separate inbox, outbox, and peer lists
- **Per-identity ACL**: Control which peers can send messages
- **OpenClaw wake settings**: Enable/disable notifications per identity
- **Autoload option**: Choose which identities load on daemon start

## Architecture

### Identity and Encryption

clawchat uses a two-tier key model:

1. **Wallet Key** (secp256k1): Your Stacks identity, signs attestations
2. **Node Key** (Ed25519): Transport encryption, bound to wallet via signed attestation

Messages are encrypted end-to-end using the Noise XX protocol pattern with ChaCha20-Poly1305.

### Gateway Mode

A single daemon process manages multiple identities:

- **IdentityManager**: Loads/unloads identities, manages per-identity state
- **MessageRouter**: Routes messages to correct identity with ACL enforcement
- **SNaP2P Protocol**: Multi-identity authentication using identity resolver pattern
- **Per-Identity Storage**: Each identity has isolated inbox/outbox/peers in `identities/{principal}/`

### Networking

- **libp2p**: Handles transports (TCP, WebSocket), multiplexing (yamux), and encryption (Noise)
- **Circuit Relay v2**: Allows connections through relay nodes when direct connection fails
- **DCUtR**: Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay for NAT hole punching
- **AutoNAT**: Automatic detection of NAT status
- **PX-1**: Custom peer exchange protocol for mesh discovery

## Access Control

Each identity can restrict which peers are allowed to connect:

```json
{
  "principal": "stacks:ST1ABC...",
  "allowedRemotePeers": ["*"]  // Allow all peers
}
```

Or restrict to specific peers:

```json
{
  "principal": "stacks:ST2XYZ...",
  "allowedRemotePeers": ["stacks:ST1ABC...", "stacks:ST3DEF..."]
}
```

Edit `~/.clawchat/gateway-config.json` to modify ACLs.

## OpenClaw Integration

Per-identity wake notifications:

```json
{
  "principal": "stacks:ST1ABC...",
  "openclawWake": true  // Enable wake for this identity
}
```

When enabled, incoming messages trigger `openclaw system event`:

```bash
openclaw system event --text "ClawChat from stacks:ST1ABC(alice): Hello!" --mode next-heartbeat
```

Priority messages (starting with `URGENT:`, `ALERT:`, or `CRITICAL:`) trigger immediate wake with `--mode now`.

## Development

```bash
# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Build
