# til

Capture and manage "Today I Learned" entries on OpenTIL -- from drafting to publishing, all within the CLI.

## Setup

1. Go to https://opentil.ai/dashboard/settings/tokens and create a Personal Access Token with `read:entries`, `write:entries`, and `delete:entries` scopes
2. Copy the token (starts with `til_`)
3. Set the environment variable:

```bash
export OPENTIL_TOKEN="til_xxx"
```

### Token Resolution

Token resolution order:
1. `$OPENTIL_TOKEN` environment variable
2. `~/.til/credentials` file (created by `/til auth`)

If neither is set, entries are saved locally to `~/.til/drafts/`.

## Subcommand Routing

The first word after `/til` determines the action. Reserved words route to management subcommands; anything else is treated as content to capture.

| Invocation | Action |
|------------|--------|
| `/til list [drafts\|published\|all]` | List entries (default: drafts) |
| `/til publish [<id> \| last]` | Publish an entry |
| `/til unpublish <id>` | Unpublish (revert to draft) |
| `/til edit <id> [instructions]` | AI-assisted edit |
| `/til search <keyword>` | Search entries by title |
| `/til delete <id>` | Delete entry (with confirmation) |
| `/til status` | Show site status and connection info |
| `/til sync` | Sync local drafts to OpenTIL |
| `/til tags` | List site tags with usage counts |
| `/til categories` | List site categories |
| `/til batch <topics>` | Batch-capture multiple TIL entries |
| `/til auth` | Connect OpenTIL account (browser auth) |
| `/til <anything else>` | Capture content as a new TIL |
| `/til` | Extract insights from conversation (multi-candidate) |

Reserved words: `list`, `publish`, `unpublish`, `edit`, `search`, `delete`, `status`, `sync`, `tags`, `categories`, `batch`, `auth`.

## Reference Loading

⚠️ DO NOT read reference files unless specified below. SKILL.md contains enough inline context for most operations.

### On subcommand dispatch (load before execution):

| Subcommand | References to load |
|------------|--------------------|
| `/til <content>` | none |
| `/til` (extract from conversation) | none |
| `/til list\|status\|tags\|categories` | [references/management.md](references/management.md) |
| `/til publish\|unpublish\|edit\|search\|delete\|batch` | [references/management.md](references/management.md) |
| `/til sync` | [references/management.md](references/management.md), [references/local-drafts.md](references/local-drafts.md) |
| `/til auth` | [references/management.md](references/management.md), [references/api.md](references/api.md) |

### On-demand (load only when the situation arises):

| Trigger | Reference to load |
|---------|-------------------|
| API returns non-2xx after inline error handling is insufficient | [references/api.md](references/api.md) |
| Auto-detection context (proactive TIL suggestion) | [references/auto-detection.md](references/auto-detection.md) |
| No token found (first-run local fallback) | [references/local-drafts.md](references/local-drafts.md) |

## API Quick Reference

**Create and publish an entry:**

```bash
curl -X POST "https://opentil.ai/api/v1/entries" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENTIL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "entry": {
      "title": "Go interfaces are satisfied implicitly",
      "content": "In Go, a type implements an interface...",
      "tag_names": ["go", "interfaces"],
      "published": true,

## Execution Flow

Every `/til` invocation follows this flow:

1. **Generate** -- craft the TIL entry (title, body, tags, lang)
2. **Check token** -- resolve token (env var → `~/.til/credentials`)
   - **Found** -> POST to API with `published: true` -> show published URL
   - **Not found** -> save to `~/.til/drafts/` -> show first-run setup guide
3. **Never lose content** -- the entry is always persisted somewhere
4. **On API failure** -> save locally as draft (fallback unchanged)

## `/til <content>` -- Explicit Capture

The user's input is **raw material** -- a seed, not the final entry. Generate a complete TIL from it:

- Short input (a sentence or phrase) -> expand into a full entry with context and examples
- Long input (a paragraph or more) -> refine and structure, but preserve the user's intent

**Steps:**

1. Treat the user's input as a seed -- craft a complete title + body from it
2. Generate a concise title (5-15 words) in the same language as the content
3. Write a self-contained Markdown body (see Content Guidelines below)
4. Infer 1-3 lowercase tags from technical domain (e.g. `rails`, `postgresql`, `go`)
5. Detect language -> set `lang` (`en`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`, `ja`, `ko`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `pt-BR`, `pt`, `ru`, `ar`, `bs`, `da`, `nb`, `pl`, `th`, `tr`, `it`)
6. Follow Execution Flow above (check token -> POST or save locally)

No confirmation needed -- the user explicitly asked to capture. Execute directly.

## `/til` -- Extract from Conversation

When `/til` is used without arguments, analyze the current conversation for learnable insights.

**Steps:**

1. Scan the conversation for knowledge worth preserving -- surprising facts, useful techniques, debugging breakthroughs, "aha" moments
2. Identify **all** TIL-worthy insights (not just one), up to 5
3. Branch based on count:

**0 insights:**
```
No clear TIL insights found in this conversation.
```

**1 insight:** Generate the full draft (title, body, tags), show it, ask for confirmation. On confirmation -> follow Execution Flow.

**2+ insights:** Show a numbered list (max 5), let the user choose:
```
Found 3 TIL-worthy insights:

  1. Go interfaces are satisfied implicitly
  2. PostgreSQL JSONB arrays don't support GIN @>
  3. CSS :has() enables parent selection

Which to capture? (1/2/3/all/none)
```

- Single number -> generate draft for that insight, show confirmation, proceed
- Comma-separated list (e.g. `1,3`) -> generate drafts for selected, show all for confirmation, POST sequentially
- `all` -> generate drafts for each, show all for confirmation, POST sequentially
- `none` -> cancel

4. For each selected insight, generate a standalone TIL entry following Content Guidelines
5. **Show the generated entry to the user and ask for confirmation before proceeding**
6. On confirmation -> follow Execution Flow above (check token -> POST or save locally)

## Auto-Detection

When working alongside a user, proactively detect moments worth capturing as TIL entries.

### When to Suggest

Suggest when the conversation produces a genuine "aha" moment — something surprising, non-obvious, or worth remembering. Examples:

- Debugging uncovered a non-obvious root cause
- A language/framework behavior contradicted common assumptions
- Refactoring revealed a clearly superior pattern
- Performance optimization yielded measurable improvement
- An obscure but useful tool flag or API parameter was discovered
- Two technologies interacting produced unexpected behavior

Do NOT suggest for: standard tool usage, documented behavior, typo-caused bugs, or widely known best practices.

### Rate Limiting

1. **Once per session** — after suggesting once (accepted or declined), never suggest again
2. **Natural pauses only** — suggest at resolution points or task boundaries, never mid-problem-solving
3. **Respect rejection** — if declined, move on without persuasion

### Suggestion Format

Append at the end of your normal response. Never interrupt workflow.

**Template:**
```
💡 TIL: [concise title of the insight]
   Tags: [tag1, tag2] · Capture? (yes/no)
```

**Example** (at the end of a debugging response):
```
...so the fix is to close the channel before the goroutine exits.

💡 TIL: Unclosed Go channels in goroutines cause silent memory leaks
   Tags: go, concurrency · Capture? (yes/no)
```

### Capture Flow

Auto-detected TILs bypass the extract flow. The suggestion itself is the candidate.

1. User replies `yes` / `y` / `ok` / `sure` → agent generates full entry (title, body, tags, lang) from the suggested insight → follows Execution Flow (POST or save locally)
2. User replies `no` / ignores / continues other topic → move on, do not ask again

Non-affirmative responses (continuing the conversation about something else) are treated as implicit decline.

## Management Subcommands

Management subcommands require a token. There is no local fallback -- management operations need the API.

### `/til list [drafts|published|all]`

List entries. Default filter: `drafts`.

- API: `GET /entries?status=<filter>&per_page=10`
- Display as a compact table with short IDs (last 8 chars, prefixed with `...`)
- Show pagination info at the bottom

### `/til publish [<id> | last]`

Publish a draft entry.

- `last` resolves to the most recently created entry in this session (tracked via `last_created_entry_id` set on every successful POST)
- Fetch the entry first, show title/tags, ask for confirmation
- On success, display the published URL
- If already published, show informational message (not an error)

### `/til unpublish <id>`

Revert a published entry to draft.

- Fetch the entry first, confirm before unpublishing
- If already a draft, show informational message

### `/til edit <id> [instructions]`

AI-assisted editing of an existing entry.

- Fetch the full entry via `GET /entries/:id`
- Apply changes based on instructions (or ask what to change if none given)
- Show a diff preview of proposed changes
- On confirmation, `PATCH /entries/:id` with only the changed fields

### `/til search <keyword>`

Search entries by title.

- API: `GET /entries?q=<keyword>&per_page=10`
- Same compact table format as `list`

### `/til delete <id>`

Permanently delete an entry.

- Fetch the entry, show title and status
- Double-confirm: "This cannot be undone. Type 'delete' to confirm."
- On confirmation, `DELETE /entries/:id`

### `/til status`

Show site status and connection info. **Works without a token** (degraded display).

- With token: `GET /site` -> show username, entry breakdown (total/published/drafts), token status, local draft count, dashboard link
- Without token: show "not connected", local draft count, setup link

### `/til sync`

Explicitly sync local drafts from `~/.til/drafts/` to OpenTIL. Requires token.

- List pending drafts, POST each one, delete local file on success
- Show summary with success/failure per draft

### `/til tags`

List site tags sorted by usage count (top 20). Requires token.

- API: `GET /tags?sort=popular&per_page=20&with_entries=true`
- Show as compact table with tag name and entry count

### `/til categories`

List site categories. Requires token.

- API: `GET /categories`
- Show as compact table with name, entry count, and description

### `/til batch <topics>`

Batch-capture multiple TIL entries in one invocation. Requires explicit topic list.

- User lists topics separated by newlines, semicolons, or markdown list items (`-` / `1.`)
- Generate a draft for each -> show all drafts for confirmation -> POST sequentially
- On partial failure, show per-entry success/failure (same format as `/til sync`)

### ID Resolution

- In listings, show IDs in short form: `...` + last 8 characters
- Accept both short and full IDs as input
- Resolve short IDs by suffix match against the current listing
- If ambiguous (multiple matches), ask for clarification

### Session State

Track `last_created_entry_id` -- set on every successful `POST /entries` (201). Used by `/til publish last`. Not persisted across sessions.

> Detailed subcommand flows, display formats, and error handling: see references/management.md

## Agent Identity

Three layers of attribution signal distinguish human-initiated from agent-initiated TILs.

### Layer 1: HTTP Headers

Include these headers on every API call:

```
X-OpenTIL-Source: human | agent
X-OpenTIL-Agent: <your agent display name>
X-OpenTIL-Model: <human-readable model name>
```

- Source: `/til <content>` and `/til` -> `human`; Auto-detected -> `agent`
- Agent: use your tool's display name (e.g. `Claude Code`, `Cursor`, `GitHub Copilot`). Do not use a slug.
- Model: use a human-readable model name (e.g. `Claude Opus 4.6`, `GPT-4o`, `Gemini 2.5 Pro`). Do not use a model ID.
- Agent and Model are optional -- omit them if you are unsure.

### Layer 2: Tag Convention

- Auto-detected TILs: automatically add `agent-assisted` to the tag list
- `/til <content>` and `/til`: do **not** add the tag (unless the Agent substantially rewrote the content)

### Layer 3: Attribution Rendering (Backend)

Agent-initiated TILs are visually marked on OpenTIL automatically based on the
`source` field. No content modification needed -- the backend renders attribution
in the display layer.

- Public page: shows `✨ via {agent_name}`, or `✨ AI` when agent_name is absent
- Tooltip (hover): shows `{agent_name} · {model}` when both are present
- Dashboard: shows ✨ badge + agent_name, or "Agent" when agent_name is absent

Do NOT append any footer or attribution text to the content body.

### Summary

| Dimension | `/til <content>` | `/til` | Auto-detected |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|---------------|
| Trigger | User explicit | User command | Agent proactive |
| Confirmations | 0 (direct publish) | 1 (review before publish) | 1 (suggest → capture) |
| Source header | `human` | `human` | `agent` |
| Agent header | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Model header | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| `agent-assisted` tag | No | No | Yes |
| Attribution | Automatic (backend) | Automatic (backend) | Automatic (backend) |

## Content Guidelines

Every TIL entry must follow these rules:

- **Self-contained**: The reader must understand the entry without any conversation context. Never write "as we discussed", "the above error", "this project's config", etc.
- **Desensitized**: Remove project names, company details, colleague names, internal URLs, and proprietary business logic. Generalize specifics: "our User model" -> "a model", "the production server" -> "a production environment", "the Acme payment service" -> "a payment gateway".
- **Universally valuable**: Write to StackOverflow-answer standards. A stranger searching for this topic should find the entry immediately useful. Content only useful to the author belongs in private notes, not TIL.
- **Factual tone**: State facts, show examples, explain why. Avoid first-person narrative ("I was debugging...", "I discovered..."). Exception: brief situational context is fine ("When upgrading Rails from 7.2 to 8.0...").
- **One insight per entry**: Each TIL teaches exactly ONE thing. If there are multiple insights, create separate entries.
- **Concrete examples**: Include code snippets, commands, or specific data whenever relevant. Avoid vague descriptions.
- **Title**: 5-15 words. Descriptive, same language as content. No "TIL:" prefix.
- **Content**: Use the most efficient format for the knowledge — tables for comparisons (before/after, options, flags), code blocks for examples, lists for enumerations. Only use prose when explaining causation or context. Never pad content; if one sentence suffices, don't write a paragraph.
- **Tags**: 1-3 lowercase tags from the technical domain (`go`, `rails`, `postgresql`, `css`, `linux`). No generic tags like `programming` or `til`.
- **Lang**: Detect from content. Chinese -> `zh-CN`, Traditional Chinese -> `zh-TW`, English -> `en`, Japanese -> `ja`, Korean -> `ko`.
- **Category**: Do not auto-infer `category_name` -- only include it if the user explicitly specifies a category/topic.

## Result Messages

### API Success (token configured, 201)

```
Published to OpenTIL

  Title:  Go interfaces are satisfied implicitly
  Tags:   go, interfaces
  URL:    https://opentil.ai/@username/go-interfaces-are-satisfied-implicitly
```

Extract the `url` field from the API response for the URL.

### Sync Local Drafts

After the first successful API call, check `~/.til/drafts/` for pending files. If any exist, offer to sync:

```
Draft saved to OpenTIL

  Title:  Go interfaces are satisfied implicitly
  Tags:   go, interfaces
  Review: https://opentil.ai/@username/go-interfaces-are-satisfied-implicitly

Found 3 local drafts from before. Sync them to OpenTIL?
```

On confirmation, POST each draft to the API. Delete the local file after each successful sync. Keep files that fail. Show summary:

```
Synced 3 local drafts to OpenTIL

  + Go defer runs in LIFO order
  + PostgreSQL JSONB indexes support GIN operators
  + CSS :has() selector enables parent selection
```

If the user declines, keep the local files and do not ask again in this session.

### First Run (no token)

Save the draft locally, then show a concise setup hint. This is NOT an error -- the user successfully captured a TIL.

```
TIL captured

  Title:  Go interfaces are satisfied implicitly
  Tags:   go, interfaces
  File:   ~/.til/drafts/20260210-143022-go-interfaces.md

Sync to OpenTIL? Run: /til auth
```

Only show the setup hint on the **first** local save in this session. On subsequent saves, use the short form:

```
TIL captured

  Title:  Go interfaces are satisfied implicitly
  Tags:   go, interfaces
  File:   ~/.til/drafts/20260210-143022-go-interfaces.md
```

## Error Handling

**On ANY API failure, always save the draft locally first.** Never let user content be lost.

**422 -- Validation error:** Analyze the error response, fix the issue (e.g. truncate title to 200 chars, correct lang code), and retry. Only save locally if the retry also fails.

**401 -- Token invalid or expired:**

```
TIL captured (saved locally -- token expired)

  File: ~/.til/drafts/20260210-143022-go-interfaces.md

Token expired. Run /til auth to reconnect.
```

**Network failure or 5xx:**

```
TIL captured (saved locally -- API unavailable)

  File: ~/.til/drafts/20260210-143022-go-interfaces.md
```

> Full error codes, 422 auto-fix logic, and rate limit details: see references/api.md

## Local Draft Fallback

When the API is unavailable or no token is configured, drafts are saved locally to `~/.til/drafts/`.

**File format:** `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<slug>.md`

```markdown
---
title: "Go interfaces are satisfied implicitly"
tags: [go, interfaces]
lang: en
---

In Go, a type implements an interface...
```

> Full directory structure, metadata fields, and sync protocol: see references/local-drafts.md

## Notes

- Entries are published immediately by default (`published: true`) -- use `/til unpublish <id>` to revert to draft
- The API auto-generates a URL slug from the title
- Tags are created automatically if they don't exist on the site
- Content is rendered to HTML server-side (Markdown with syntax highlighting)
- Management subcommands (`list`, `publish`, `edit`, `search`, `delete`, `tags`, `categories`, `sync`, `batch`) require a token -- no local fallback. Exception: `status` and `auth` work without a token.
- Scope errors map to specific scopes: `list`/`search`/`tags`/`categories` need `read:entries`, `publish`/`unpublish`/`edit`/`sync`/`batch` need `write:entries`, `delete` needs `delete:entries`. `status` uses `read:entries` when available but works without a token.
