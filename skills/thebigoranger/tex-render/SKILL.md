# TeX Render 📐

Renders LaTeX math to PNG, JPEG, WebP, or AVIF (and SVG). Use when you need a **viewable image** from LaTeX instead of raw code.

## Location

The render script lives in the **same skill folder** as this `SKILL.md`:

```
<skill_folder>/
├── SKILL.md
├── package.json
└── scripts/
    └── render.js
```

Use the **directory containing this SKILL.md** as the skill path. The script is at `scripts/render.js` relative to that folder. Invoke: `node <skill_folder>/scripts/render.js`. The agent loading this skill has the skill path—use it to run the script.

## Install

One-time setup. `cd` into the skill folder (the directory containing this SKILL.md), then run:

```bash
cd <skill_folder>
npm install
```

## When to Use

- User or task asks to "render this equation as image" or "show formula as picture"
- Your reply would contain LaTeX — render formulas as images first, then respond with plain text

## Workflow: Response Contains LaTeX

Output your reply **interleaved**: whenever you would output LaTeX, do this instead:

1. **Send the preceding plain text** — call `message` with the text written so far (no LaTeX).
2. **Render** the LaTeX expression with this skill (default PNG; no `--output dataurl`). Parse the JSON for the PNG path.
3. **Send the image** — call `message` with `action: "send"`, `path` set to the rendered PNG, and `message` as short caption.
4. **Continue** outputting the rest of the message. Repeat the cycle (text → render → send image) for each LaTeX block.

Do **not** output raw LaTeX. Do **not** ask the user for permission to render — render and send images immediately when LaTeX would appear in your reply. Do **not** accumulate everything and send at the end — send text and images in order as you go.

> **Critical:** Output in order: plain text → send → LaTeX → render → send image → plain text → send → LaTeX → render → send image → … The user must receive text and images in the natural reading order.

**Example**: Explaining Lagrangian:  
→ Send "The Lagrangian is defined as " → Render `L = T - V` → Send image with caption "L = T - V" → Send ". The Euler-Lagrange equation is " → Render `d/dt(∂L/∂q̇) - ∂L/∂q = 0` → Send image → Send " — this yields the equations of motion."

## Usage

Run: `node <skill_folder>/scripts/render.js` (or `node scripts/render.js` when already in the skill folder).

**Escaping:** When invoking via shell:
- **Single quotes** for LaTeX without apostrophe: `node scripts/render.js '\frac{d}{dt}'`
- **Stdin** when LaTeX contains apostrophe (e.g. `y'` for derivative): `printf '%s' "y' = f(t, y), \quad y(t_0)=y_0" | node scripts/render.js` — use double quotes so `'` is literal; backslashes like `\quad` stay intact.

```bash
node <skill_folder>/scripts/render.js --help
```

Default output is PNG to `~/.openclaw/media/tex-render/`. The script prints one JSON line with file paths: `{"svg":"...","png":"..."}` or `{"svg":"...","jpeg":"..."}`, etc. Use `--output dataurl` only when the conversation system explicitly supports Data URL images (otherwise it may show raw base64 text).

### Examples (validated by npm test)

Use `<skill_folder>` = the directory containing this SKILL.md.

**Basic (PNG default):**
```bash
node <skill_folder>/scripts/render.js 'E = mc^2'
node <skill_folder>/scripts/render.js '$$\frac{F}{m}=a$$'
```

**LaTeX with apostrophe (e.g. y'):** use stdin to avoid shell quoting issues:
```bash
printf '%s' "y' = f(t, y), \quad y(t_0)=y_0" | node <skill_folder>/scripts/render.js
```

**JPEG / WebP / AVIF:**
```bash
node <skill_folder>/scripts/render.js --format jpeg --quality 80 '\frac{F}{m}=a' ./out/formula
node <skill_folder>/scripts/render.js --format webp 'x^2 + y^2 = z^2'
node <skill_folder>/scripts/render.js --format avif 'E = mc^2'
```

**Data URL (no file):**
```bash
node <skill_folder>/scripts/render.js --output dataurl 'E = mc^2'
```

**Scale by width:**
```bash
node <skill_folder>/scripts/render.js --width 800 '\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx'
```

**Inline math (smaller rendering):**
```bash
node <skill_folder>/scripts/render.js --inline 'a^2 + b^2 = c^2'
```

**Height and zoom:** Use `--height N` or `--zoom N` as documented in `--help`.

## Automatic Triggering (TOOLS.md)

To make the agent use tex-render **without** the user explicitly asking, add to your workspace `TOOLS.md`:

```markdown
## LaTeX in Responses (tex-render)

**Whenever your reply would contain LaTeX** (equations, formulas, scientific notation), **use the tex-render skill** automatically. Examples: physics, math, chemistry questions with formulas.

**Workflow:** send plain text → render LaTeX → send image via message tool → continue text. Use single quotes when invoking (e.g. `'\frac{a}{b}'`).

### LaTeX / Equations (tex-render)

- When answering scientific or math questions, if your reply would contain LaTeX, use tex-render and send images — do this automatically.
```

**Test:** Ask "Explain the Lagrangian formula" without mentioning tex-render. The agent should render and send images.
