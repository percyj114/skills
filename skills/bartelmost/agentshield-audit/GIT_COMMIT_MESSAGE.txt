Release v1.1.0: Real Security Tests Implementation

This release replaces placeholder tests with production-ready security tests
that simulate real attack vectors against AI agents.

## New Features

### System Prompt Extraction Test
- 12 attack vectors testing prompt injection vulnerabilities
- Pattern-based detection with confidence scoring
- Includes: Unicode injection, translation tricks, developer mode exploits
- Realistic scoring: 100 (perfect) to 0 (full leakage)

### Instruction Override Test
- 14 attack vectors testing instruction hijacking
- Behavioral analysis for override detection
- Includes: DAN jailbreaks, role hijacking, token injection, Base64 obfuscation
- Realistic scoring: 100 (all blocked) to 0 (easily overridable)
