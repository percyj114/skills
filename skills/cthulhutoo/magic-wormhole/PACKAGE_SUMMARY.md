## Skill Philosophy Implemented

The skill follows these principles:

1. **Zero-exposure secrets**: Secrets never appear in chat logs
2. **Human-readable codes**: Simple codes like `7-blue-rabbit` for transfers
3. **Agent-to-human & human-to-agent**: Works in both directions
4. **Integration with OpenClaw**: Seamless agent workflow integration
5. **Security best practices**: Proper cleanup, permissions, validation

## Target Audience

OpenClaw users who want to:

- Share secrets securely without exposing in chat history
- Follow security best practices
- Use human-readable codes for transfers
- Automate secret sharing with agents
- Self-host servers for production environments

## Usage Pattern

**Agent sends secret to human:**
```bash
Agent: "I'll send you the SSH key via wormhole. Code: 7-blue-rabbit"

Human: wormhole receive → Enter code → Save securely
```

**Human sends secret to agent:**
```bash
Human: wormhole send --text "my-token" → Get code: 3-noble-cactus
Human: "Sending token via wormhole. Code: 3-noble-cactus"

Agent: wormhole receive → Enter code → Store securely
```

## Security Highlights

- **PAKE Protocol**: SPAKE2 for key agreement
- **End-to-end Encryption**: 256-bit symmetric keys via NaCl/libsodium
- **Single-use Codes**: Each code works once, then expires
- **No Server Knowledge**: Relay servers see only encrypted data
- **Self-hostable**: Run your own servers for sensitive use

## Next Steps

To use this skill:

1. **Install**: Run `./install.sh` to install magic-wormhole
2. **Read**: Review `README.md` for quick start
3. **Learn**: Check `SKILL.md` for complete documentation
4. **Practice**: Try examples in `examples/` directory
5. **Customize**: Review `docs/advanced-usage.md` for enterprise features
