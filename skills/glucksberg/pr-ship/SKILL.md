description: Pre-ship risk report for OpenClaw PRs. Dynamically explores the codebase to assess module risk, blast radius, and version-specific gotchas. Scores each finding by severity (🟢/🟡/🔴). Updated frequently with the latest OpenClaw version context — run `clawhub update pr-ship` regularly to stay current.

# pr-ship

## Overview

Pre-ship risk report for **[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** pull requests.

This skill is **updated frequently** to track OpenClaw releases. The version-specific context (gotchas, behavioral changes, active risk areas) is refreshed with each upstream release. Run `clawhub update pr-ship` periodically to get the latest context.

What it does:
- Diffs your current branch against `main` in the OpenClaw repository.
- Dynamically investigates each changed module using grep/find/git on the codebase itself.
- Produces a structured risk report with evidence-backed findings scored by severity (🟢/🟡/🔴).
- No approve/reject gate -- just information for you to decide what to fix before publishing.

## Reference Layers

Load these files from the `references/` directory. Each serves a distinct purpose:

1. **`STABLE-PRINCIPLES.md`** -- Timeless OpenClaw coding standards: testing guide, file naming, safety invariants, common pitfalls, PR practices.

2. **`ARCHITECTURE-MAP.md`** -- OpenClaw structural context: module hierarchy, risk tier definitions with calibrated thresholds, critical path patterns, cross-module coupling, change impact matrix.

3. **`CURRENT-CONTEXT.md`** *(optional)* -- Version-specific gotchas, recent behavioral changes, and active risk areas. If this file exists, load it. It tracks the current OpenClaw release.

4. **`EXPLORATION-PLAYBOOK.md`** -- Dynamic investigation procedures. Read-only commands (grep, find, ls, git) that discover the current state of the OpenClaw codebase.

5. **`VISION-GUIDELINES.md`** -- Project vision, contribution policy, and merge guardrails derived from OpenClaw's VISION.md. Covers PR scope rules, security philosophy, plugin/core boundary, skills policy, MCP strategy, and the explicit "will not merge" list. Use this to catch policy and architectural misalignment.

STABLE-PRINCIPLES, ARCHITECTURE-MAP, EXPLORATION-PLAYBOOK, and VISION-GUIDELINES should always be present. CURRENT-CONTEXT is optional -- if missing, the skill still works but without version-specific gotcha awareness.

## Workflow

### 1. Load reference layers
- Read the four reference files listed above.

### 2. Collect diff against `main`
- Get current branch: `git branch --show-current`
- Gather file list: `git diff --name-only main...HEAD`
- Gather patch content: `git diff main...HEAD`

### 3. Classify changed modules
- For each changed file, identify its `src/<module>/` path.
- Look up the module's risk tier in ARCHITECTURE-MAP.md.
- If the module isn't listed or you want to verify, run the dynamic consumer count from EXPLORATION-PLAYBOOK.md "Dynamic Risk Classification" section.

### 4. Run dynamic exploration per changed module
- Follow EXPLORATION-PLAYBOOK.md "Blast Radius Discovery" for each changed file.
- Follow "Module-Specific Investigation Strategies" for each changed module type.
- Follow "Test Discovery" to identify relevant tests.
- Check "Red Flags Table" against the diff.

### 5. Evaluate findings
- Compare exploration evidence against:
  - Safety invariants and common pitfalls from STABLE-PRINCIPLES.md
  - Version-specific gotchas from CURRENT-CONTEXT.md (if loaded)
  - Architecture coupling patterns from ARCHITECTURE-MAP.md
  - Contribution policy, merge guardrails, and architectural direction from VISION-GUIDELINES.md
- Check PR scope against Vision contribution rules (one PR = one topic, size limits, bundling policy).
- Check for "will not merge" category matches from VISION-GUIDELINES.md section 7.
- Evaluate whether new capabilities respect the plugin/core boundary and security philosophy.
- Every finding must include:
  - **Evidence** from the diff (file + snippet)
  - **Exploration evidence** (command output showing blast radius, consumers, or pattern match)
  - **Reference** to the specific principle, gotcha, or coupling pattern it relates to

### 6. Produce report
- Use the report format below.
- Do not output "approved/rejected".

## Severity and Alert Scoring

- 🟢 **Low Risk** (score 1-2)
  Minor observation, style preference, or informational note. Safe to ship as-is.

- 🟡 **Attention Needed** (score 3-6)
  Partial mismatch, ambiguity, missing hardening, or non-blocking inconsistency. Worth reviewing but unlikely to cause breakage.

- 🔴 **High Risk** (score 7-10)
  Clear conflict with OpenClaw coding standards, architecture patterns, or version-specific constraints. Likely to cause bugs, regressions, or policy violations.

Scoring:
- Score each finding individually (1-10).
- `final_alert_score = max(per_finding_scores)`. If no findings, `final_alert_score = 0`.

## Report Format

```markdown
## pr-ship report

- Branch: `<current-branch>`
- Base: `main`
- Files changed: `<N>`
- Modules touched: `<list with risk tiers>`
- Findings: `<N>`
- Final alert score: `<0-10>`

### Module Risk Summary

| Module | Risk Tier | Consumers | Files Changed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <module> | CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | <N> | <N> |

### Findings

1. 🟢/🟡/🔴 Title
   - Alert: `<1-10>`
   - Reference: `<principle, gotcha, or pattern from reference docs>`
   - Evidence in diff: `<file + short snippet/description>`
   - Exploration evidence: `<what dynamic investigation revealed>`
   - Why this matters: `<1-2 lines>`
   - Suggested fix: `<1-2 concrete actions>`

(repeat)

### Executive summary
- `<short practical summary for decision>`
- `<top 1-3 actions before publishing PR>`
```

## Constraints

- This skill is for the **OpenClaw repository only**. Do not use it on other projects.
- Review only the current branch diff against `main`.
- Do not review unrelated repository history.
- Do not auto-edit code unless explicitly asked.
- Do not convert the report into an approve/reject decision unless explicitly requested.
- Exploration commands are **read-only** (grep, find, ls, git diff). Never execute build, test, or code generation commands -- recommend them to the user in findings instead.
