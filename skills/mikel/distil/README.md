# Distil — OpenClaw Native Skill

This directory contains the **Distil native skill for [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai)** — a minimal bash-based command that gives AI agents running inside OpenClaw direct, zero-configuration access to the Distil web proxy.

## What's in this folder

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `SKILL.md` | OpenClaw skill manifest — describes the skill to OpenClaw and documents commands for the agent |

## How it works

When OpenClaw discovers this skill, it:

1. Reads `SKILL.md` to learn the skill name, description, and what commands are available
2. **Currently, you must manually install the `distil-mcp` npm package** (see Installation section below). Future versions of OpenClaw may auto-install based on the skill metadata.
3. The agent can then call `distil fetch <URL>` or `distil search <query>` directly from shell commands

The `distil` script resolves your API key from the `DISTIL_API_KEY` env var, constructs the correct proxy URL, and fires a `curl` request — returning clean Markdown to stdout.

## Installation

### Via NPM

```bash
npm install -g distil-mcp
```

**Security Note:** Before installing, verify the package provenance:
- Check the package details: `npm view distil-mcp`
- Visit the package page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/distil-mcp
- Ensure you're installing from the official source

Set the `DISTIL_API_KEY` environment variable

### Verify the install

```bash
distil fetch https://example.com
```

You should get clean Markdown back. If you see an error about a missing API key, check your Keychain entry.

## Usage

```bash
# Fetch any URL as clean Markdown
distil fetch https://example.com

# Search the web and get results as Markdown
distil search "best practices for Go error handling"

# Multi-word queries work naturally — no quoting needed
distil search top 10 AI companies 2025

# Force a fresh fetch (bypass cache)
DISTIL_EXTRA_HEADERS="-H X-Distil-No-Cache:true" distil fetch https://news.ycombinator.com

# Limit response size (saves tokens on very long pages)
DISTIL_EXTRA_HEADERS="-H X-Distil-Max-Tokens:2000" distil fetch https://long-article.example.com
```

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. Defaults work for most users.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `DISTIL_API_KEY` | (none) | Your Distil API key |
| `DISTIL_PROXY_URL` | `https://proxy.distil.ai/` | Proxy base URL — override for self-hosted instances |
| `DISTIL_EXTRA_HEADERS` | (none) | Extra `curl -H` flags passed to every request |

## Output

- **`distil fetch`** — page content as clean Markdown on stdout, HTTP errors on stderr
- **`distil search`** — search results (titles, URLs, descriptions) as Markdown on stdout
- **Exit codes** — `0` on success, `1` on any error (missing key, HTTP failure, bad usage)

## Getting an API key

Sign up at [distil.ai](https://distil.ai) — free tier includes 500 requests/month.

Your key looks like `dk_yourkey`. Store it in an environment variable.

```bash
export DISTIL_API_KEY=dk_yourkey
```

## Troubleshooting

**"No API key found"** — set your environment variable `DISTIL_API_KEY=dk_yourkey`

**"fetch failed"** — check `curl -v https://proxy.distil.ai/` to confirm connectivity; verify your key is valid at [distil.ai/usage](https://distil.ai/usage)
