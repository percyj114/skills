## Vendor Consolidation

### Signs You Need Consolidation:
- Multiple tools doing same job
- Integration overhead is high
- License spend is fragmented
- Support relationships too many

### Consolidation Process:
1. Inventory all vendors (spend, users, contracts)
2. Map to capability categories
3. Identify overlap and gaps
4. Score vendors in each category
5. Build migration plan with timeline
6. Execute with change management
