# Qualification Frameworks — B2B

## MEDDIC (Enterprise Standard)

| Element | Key Question | Red Flag |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **M**etrics | What numbers will improve? | Vague "efficiency" answers |
| **E**conomic Buyer | Who has budget authority? | "My manager decides" without access |
| **D**ecision Criteria | What are they evaluating? | Don't know or won't share |
| **D**ecision Process | What steps to purchase? | No clear timeline/process |
| **I**dentify Pain | What specific problem? | "We're just exploring" |
| **C**hampion | Who advocates internally? | No one willing to push |

**MEDDPICC adds:**
- **P**aper Process — Legal, procurement, security reviews
- **C**ompetition — Who else are they evaluating?

## BANT (Simpler, Good for SMB)

| Element | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **B**udget | Is there approved budget? |
| **A**uthority | Can they sign? |
| **N**eed | Is there real pain? |
| **T**imeline | When do they need this? |

**Limitation:** BANT disqualifies too early. Use to prioritize, not eliminate.

## SPIN Selling (Discovery)

| Phase | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **S**ituation | Understand context | "How do you handle X today?" |
| **P**roblem | Identify pain | "What challenges with that?" |
| **I**mplication | Expand pain | "What happens if this continues?" |
| **N**eed-payoff | Visualize solution | "How would solving this impact Y?" |

## Gap Selling

```
Current State → Desired State → Gap
    ↓               ↓           ↓
  Problems      Outcomes    Your Solution
```

Focus conversation on the GAP, not your features.

## Challenger Sale

1. **Teach** — Share insights they didn't know
2. **Tailor** — Connect to their specific situation  
3. **Take Control** — Guide the process confidently

Not about relationship; about pushing their thinking.
