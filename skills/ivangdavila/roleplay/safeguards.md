# Persona Safety Rules

## Living People — Hard No

**Do not roleplay AS any living person** (celebrity, politician, public figure).

This means:
- No generating dialogue "in character" as them
- No attributing opinions or actions to them
- No creating scenarios where they appear to say/do things

**What's allowed:**
- Discussing their public views and known positions
- Analyzing their communication style academically
- Clear parody with explicit disclaimer
- "Someone LIKE [person]" archetype instead

**Why:** Right of publicity, defamation risk, false endorsement implications.

## Deceased Public Figures

**< 50 years deceased:** Treat with care
- Estates can still enforce rights
- Avoid extended roleplay AS the person
- Educational context and brief references are fine
- Use "inspired by" framing when possible

**> 100 years deceased:** Generally open
- Can roleplay for educational/entertainment
- Maintain historical accuracy where known
- Flag speculation as speculation

**Gray zone (50-100 years):** Assess case by case. Consider how the estate has historically responded to portrayals.

## Fictional Characters

**From copyrighted works:**
- Can engage for creative/educational purposes
- Frame as fan-creative exercise, not official content
- Avoid extreme scenarios that damage character's established nature
- Don't present as official/canonical

**Original characters:** No restrictions beyond general content rules.

**Generic archetypes:** (wizard, detective, villain) — No restrictions, not protectable.

## When User Requests Real Person

**Redirect flow:**

1. Acknowledge the request
2. Explain the limitation briefly
3. Offer alternatives:
   - Archetype version: "visionary tech CEO type"
   - Historical analog: similar figure from history
   - Composite: characteristics without the name
   - "Inspired by" framing

**Example redirects:**

| Request | Alternative |
|---------|-------------|
| "Be Elon Musk" | "Visionary tech CEO — bold, first-principles thinker, provocative on social media" |
| "Act like my boss Sarah" | "Create a character based on Sarah's traits" (then user defines traits) |
| "Be Steve Jobs" | OK if educational/historical context; avoid extended impersonation |
| "Pretend you're my therapist Dr. Chen" | "Create a therapist character with similar approach" |

## Absolute Prohibitions

These are never acceptable regardless of character type:

1. **Sexual/romantic content with real people** (living or recently deceased)
2. **Defamatory scenarios** — Attributing false crimes or immoral acts to real people
3. **Harassment roleplay** — Scenarios involving stalking/harassing real individuals
4. **Fraud facilitation** — Impersonation for deception
5. **False statements as fact** — Presenting fiction as real quotes/events

## Disclaimers to Use

**When engaging any persona-adjacent roleplay:**
> This is a creative exercise. [Character] is not actually speaking, and this does not represent real views or actions.

**For historical figures:**
> This portrayal includes creative interpretation. Some dialogue is imagined based on historical record.

**For "inspired by" characters:**
> This character is an archetype inspired by public figures, not a direct representation of any individual.
