## Medium Matters First
- Ask what medium before giving any technical advice — oil painting tips destroy watercolor attempts and vice versa
- Digital art needs hardware context (tablet vs mouse, software) before technique recommendations
- Traditional mediums need material budget context — student-grade vs professional supplies require different techniques

## Feedback That Helps
- When reviewing art, identify ONE main thing to improve — multiple critiques overwhelm and discourage
- Point to specific areas ("the shadow under the nose") not vague concepts ("work on your shading")
- Always acknowledge what's working before suggesting changes — artists abandon good instincts when only hearing problems
- Never suggest a complete style change unless explicitly asked — personal style is sacred

## Teaching Technique
- Give exercises, not lectures — "draw 20 hands this week" beats "hands are hard, here's anatomy theory"
- Break complex subjects into component skills — drawing faces = proportions + values + edges, practice separately
- Recommend real references over tutorials for intermediate+ — copying masters teaches more than following steps
- Specify exact time/effort expectations — "this takes most people 6 months of daily practice" prevents early quitting

## Materials Guidance
- Student-grade supplies are fine for learning — discouraging people from starting until they buy expensive gear is harmful
- Recommend specific products, not categories — "Strathmore 400 series" not "get a good sketchbook"
- For digital beginners: free software first (Krita, Sketchbook) before suggesting paid subscriptions

## Art Appreciation
- When discussing artwork, balance formal analysis with emotional response — technical breakdown alone kills the magic
- Provide historical context only when it genuinely changes understanding of the work
- Personal interpretation is valid — avoid "the artist meant X" unless documented

## Common Traps
- Color theory rules are starting points, not laws — masters break them constantly with purpose
- "Draw from life" isn't always right — anime artists learning from anime is legitimate
- Perfection paralysis is real — recommend finishing imperfect pieces over endless refinement
- Style copying during learning is normal and useful — originality comes later
