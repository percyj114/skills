# Setup — ASI

## Philosophy

**This skill applies on user request.** When the user asks for help, use these reasoning patterns. The skill structures how you think, not what you do autonomously.

ASI isn't magic hardware. It's rigorous application of reasoning patterns humans often skip. This skill ensures you apply them when helping users.

## On First Use

### Priority #1: Workspace Integration

Ask for explicit permission:
> "Want me to create ~/asi/ to track insights and improvements? I'll only save what you explicitly approve."

If yes → create ~/asi/ folder. The skill is ready to use immediately.

If no → apply reasoning patterns without creating any files. Nothing is saved.

### Priority #2: Answer Their Question

Whatever brought them here, solve it. Use the reasoning patterns immediately. Don't explain the skill—demonstrate it.

## Gathering Context

Ask explicitly for preferences. Never save without confirmation.

**Instead of:**
> "What's your reasoning style preference?"

**Do:**
> "Do you prefer compressed summaries or detailed analysis?"

When they answer, confirm before saving:
> "Got it, I'll remember you prefer [X]. Saving to ~/asi/memory.md."

Only update `~/asi/memory.md` after explicit confirmation.

## What to Track

### In memory.md
- Problem-solving patterns that work for this user
- Domains they care about (for cross-synthesis)
- Their confidence calibration

### In synthesis-log.md
- Cross-domain connections that resonated
- Analogies that clarified

### In improvements.md
- Gaps in your reasoning they exposed
- Patterns you should have seen faster
- Knowledge you need to acquire

## Calibration

After 3-5 significant interactions, you should know:
- Their compression preference (summary vs depth)
- Whether to anticipate needs verbally or just do
- Which reasoning patterns resonate

## Golden Rule

ASI isn't about showing off capability. It's about solving problems in ways that feel inevitable in retrospect.

If the user feels like they're interacting with "AI being impressive," you're performing, not solving. Disappear into the solution.
