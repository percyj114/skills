## Must-See Attractions

### Truly Worth It ✅

| Attraction | Why It's Worth It | Price (AED) | Time Needed | Best Time |
|------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Al Fahidi Historical Neighbourhood** | Authentic old Dubai, free to explore, cultural immersion | FREE | 2-3h | Morning (cooler) |
| **Dubai Fountain Show** | World-class water/light show, iconic | FREE | 30min per show | Evening (6pm-11pm, every 30min) |
| **Kite Beach** | Free public beach, 24/7, views of Burj Al Arab | FREE | Half day | Sunset |
| **Dubai Mall (exterior/free areas)** | Waterfall, aquarium viewing, Chinatown area | FREE | 2-4h | Any |
| **Dubai Creek & Abra Ride** | Authentic experience, cheap | 1 AED per ride | 1-2h | Morning or sunset |
| **La Perle** | Spectacular live acrobatics show, underrated | ~400-600 | 90min | Evening |
| **Ras Al Khor Wildlife Sanctuary** | Flamingos in the desert, surreal | FREE | 1-2h | Nov-March (winter) |
| **Museum of the Future** | Stunning architecture, thought-provoking exhibits | ~150-180 | 2-3h | Book 2-3 weeks ahead |
| **Sky Views Observatory** | Better value than Burj Khalifa, glass slide included | ~80-120 | 1-2h | Sunset |

### Worth It With Caveats ⚠️

| Attraction | Caveat | Recommendation |
|------------|--------|----------------|
| **Burj Khalifa At The Top** | Expensive, crowded, long queues | Go to **At.mosphere restaurant** instead (same views + meal) or Sky Views |
| **Dubai Frame** | Great from outside; inside is "meh" | Just photograph from Zabeel Park, skip interior |
| **Desert Safari** | Many are tourist traps with rushed experiences | Book premium/private tours, avoid cheapest options |
| **Gold Souk & Spice Souk** | Can feel pushy, tourist-oriented | Go early morning, don't buy gold here (better prices elsewhere) |

## Tourist Traps to AVOID ❌

### 1. **Overpriced Burj Khalifa Peak Hours**
- **Problem**: Sunset tickets cost 229+ AED vs 159 AED non-peak
- **Reality**: You barely see sunset from inside (you're in elevator)
- **Alternative**: Book 1.5h before sunset OR go to Sky Views Observatory for 1/3 the price

### 2. **Budget Desert Safaris**
- **Problem**: "1-minute camel ride just for Instagram photo" — rushed, impersonal
- **Warning signs**: Under 150 AED, large groups (30+ people)
- **Alternative**: Book private tour (~300-500 AED) or premium small-group (~200 AED)

### 3. **Souk Madinat Jumeirah (for shopping)**
- **Problem**: "Tourist trap" per Reddit locals — heavily marked up prices
- **OK for**: Photos, atmosphere, restaurants with Burj Al Arab views
- **Not for**: Actually buying souvenirs

### 4. **Restaurants Near Major Attractions**
- **Problem**: Exorbitant prices, mediocre quality
- **Especially**: Dubai Mall food court (exception: Time Out Market is good)
- **Alternative**: Eat in Karama, Bur Dubai, Rigga, Muraqqabat, Hor Al Anz (locals' areas)

### 5. **Atlantis Aquaventure (peak prices)**
- **Problem**: Can cost 350+ AED on weekends/holidays
- **Alternative**: Book well ahead, look for combo deals, or go to Wild Wadi instead

### 6. **Quad Biking Add-ons**
- **Problem**: "125 AED for 30 minutes is robbery" — overpriced activity
- **If you want it**: Book standalone quad tour, not as add-on
