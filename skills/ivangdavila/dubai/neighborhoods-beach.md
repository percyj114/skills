1. **Palm traffic:** If you work in DIFC/Downtown, add 45 min each way to commute
2. **Jumeirah villas:** Always do a thorough inspection — old properties have issues
3. **Al Sufouh:** Verify building age and quality before signing
4. **Beach access:** "Close to beach" ≠ "beach view" ≠ "private beach" — clarify
5. **Service charges:** Palm is highest; ask exact number before committing
6. **Seasonal pricing:** June-August = better deals across all beach areas
7. **Villa maintenance:** Budget AED 20-40K/year for repairs on older villas
8. **Humidity:** Beach living = more AC costs, potential mold issues in older units
