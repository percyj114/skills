2. **Cheques:** 4 cheques standard; 1 cheque = 5-10% discount usually
3. **Building age:** Avoid towers built 2008-2010 (construction quality issues)
4. **View verification:** "Marina view" or "sea view" — visit unit before signing
5. **Summer rental:** June-August = better deals, less competition
6. **Pet policy:** JLT most pet-friendly; verify building policy everywhere
7. **Parking:** Always negotiate parking included in rent
8. **Service charges:** Ask specific amount — varies wildly by tower
