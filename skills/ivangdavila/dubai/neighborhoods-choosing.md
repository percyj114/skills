## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Choosing Based on Instagram
**Mistake:** "I want to live in Palm because it looks amazing"  
**Reality:** 45-min commute each way, traffic nightmare, isolated

### 2. Ignoring School Logistics
**Mistake:** "We'll figure out schools later"  
**Reality:** Good schools have 1-2 year waitlists; choose area after school acceptance

### 3. Underestimating Commute
**Mistake:** "30 minutes isn't bad"  
**Reality:** Add 50% for Dubai traffic reality; multiply by 10 years

### 4. Overpaying for Views
**Mistake:** "I need Burj Khalifa view"  
**Reality:** You'll look at it twice, then close the blinds because of heat/glare

### 5. Signing Without Visiting
**Mistake:** "The photos looked great"  
**Reality:** "Pool view" might mean "construction site in 6 months"

### 6. Not Calculating Total Costs
**Mistake:** "AED 120K rent fits my budget"  
**Reality:** Add 5% housing fee + service charges + parking + utilities = AED 150K+

## 💡 Pro Tips From Long-Term Residents

1. **"Test drive" your commute** before signing — preferably at 8 AM on a weekday
2. **Talk to current residents** — Facebook groups are goldmines for real experiences
3. **Negotiate in summer** — June-August is slow season, better deals
4. **Don't overpay for "views"** — Most people work from home with blinds closed
5. **Factor in lifestyle costs** — Cheap rent in remote area = expensive taxis
6. **Schools first, neighborhood second** — If you have kids, this is non-negotiable
7. **Try before you commit** — 3-month furnished rental first is worth the premium
8. **Join community groups** — Each area has its own WhatsApp/Facebook community
