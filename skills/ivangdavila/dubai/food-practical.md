# Dubai Dining: Practical Information

## Ramadan Dining

Ramadan is the Islamic holy month when Muslims fast from sunrise to sunset. In Dubai, the rules have relaxed significantly in recent years, but understanding them enhances your experience.

### Dates (2026)
- **Start:** ~February 17, 2026
- **End:** ~March 19, 2026 (Eid Al-Fitr)
- Dates vary by 1-2 days based on moon sighting

### Key Rules

|------|---------|
| **Public eating** | Now ALLOWED during day (relaxed from 2021) |
| **Restaurant hours** | Many open all day; some close until iftar |
| **Alcohol** | Licensed venues CAN serve, but many limit to after sunset |
| **Music** | Live entertainment prohibited; background music restricted |
| **Dress code** | Extra modesty recommended |

### What Changes

**Daytime:**
- Most restaurants open (change from previous years)
- Some use screens/curtains out of respect
- Malls and food courts operate normally
- Fast food chains open
- Traffic lighter (shorter work hours)

**Evening (Iftar onwards):**
- Extremely busy 6-9 PM
- Special iftar menus everywhere

## Dietary Options

### Halal

**Everything in Dubai is halal by default** unless specifically labeled otherwise.
