## Common Mistakes Parents Make

1. **Applying too late** - top schools fill by December/January
2. **Not considering curriculum continuity** - switching curricula mid-way is challenging
3. **Choosing only on fees** - cheap doesn't mean good value
4. **Ignoring location/commute** - Dubai traffic is brutal at school times
5. **Not checking KHDA reports** - contains valuable detail on school performance
6. **Underestimating total costs** - tuition is just the start
7. **Not visiting schools** - atmospheres differ significantly
8. **Assuming all British schools are the same** - huge quality range
9. **Ignoring class sizes** - ask for actual numbers, not just limits
10. **Not planning for secondary** - primary feeder schools matter

## Making the Right Choice

### Questions to Ask Schools:
- What is the average class size?
- What percentage of teachers are qualified?
- What is staff turnover like?
- What are exam results (IGCSE, A-Level, IB)?
- What extracurricular activities are offered?
- What learning support is available?
- What is the homework policy?
- How do you communicate with parents?

### Decision Framework:
1. **Budget:** What can you realistically afford for all children?
2. **Curriculum:** What best suits your child and your plans?
3. **Location:** How far are you willing to travel?
4. **Quality:** KHDA rating and reputation
5. **Fit:** Does the school match your child's needs?
