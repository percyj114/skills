| 3-Bedroom | 180,000+ | 140,000-250,000 | 12,000-21,000 |

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Negotiate rent** — Market is stabilizing in 2026; ask for 2 free months on annual lease
2. **Service charges** — Ask exact amount before signing; can be 15-25K/year on top of rent
3. **Furnished vs Unfurnished** — Furnished adds 15-25% to rent
4. **Parking** — In Downtown, buy a parking pass separately or you'll suffer
5. **Peak season** — August-October is hunting season; plan 2 months ahead
