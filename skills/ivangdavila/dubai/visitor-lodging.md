4. **Beach vacation**: JBR (best balance) or Palm (if money no object)

### Booking Tips

- **Book 2-4 weeks ahead** for best rates
- **Avoid**: New Year's Eve, Dubai Shopping Festival (Jan), school holidays
- **Best deals**: May-September (summer = empty hotels, but brutal heat)
- **Weekends (Fri-Sat)**: Slightly more expensive than weekdays

### Hidden Costs to Watch

- **Resort fees**: Some hotels add AED 50-150/night
- **Beach access**: Some hotels charge for non-private beach access
- **Parking**: AED 50-150/day in downtown hotels
- **WiFi**: Usually free, but premium/fast WiFi may cost extra

### Hotel Apartments (Great for Families/Long Stays)

Better value than hotels for stays 5+ days:
