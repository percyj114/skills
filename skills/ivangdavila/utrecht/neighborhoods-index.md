## Rental Market Reality

### Supply vs Demand

- Social housing: 10+ year waitlist
- Private market: 20+ applicants per listing
- Expats often outbid by offering more months upfront

### What to Expect
- Finding housing: 2-6 months of searching
- Viewings: Mass viewings, quick decisions needed
- Documents needed: Employer letter, payslips, ID
- Scams: Common — never pay before seeing property

### Strategy
1. Start before moving
2. Register for social housing anyway (long-term)
3. Use housing agencies (expensive but effective)
4. Consider surrounding towns first
5. Temporary housing while searching (hostels, short-stay)
