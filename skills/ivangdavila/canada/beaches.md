# Beaches and Lake Towns — Canada

## British Columbia

- **Kitsilano Beach (Vancouver):** Easy city-beach mix, best in clear summer windows.
- **English Bay:** Sunset-heavy social scene, busy in peak evenings.
- **Tofino area beaches (Vancouver Island):** Dramatic landscapes, strong surf culture, weather-variable.

## Ontario

- **Toronto Islands beaches:** Convenient city escape, best on calm-weather days.
- **Wasaga Beach:** Huge sandy stretch, summer crowd density can be high.
- **Prince Edward County shores:** Better paired with food and wine routes.

## Atlantic Canada

- **Prince Edward Island coastal beaches:** Family-friendly rhythm and classic east-coast vibe.
- **Nova Scotia beaches:** Scenic and varied, but water temperature expectations matter.

## Practical Notes

- Water temperatures are often cooler than visitors expect, even in summer.
- Parking and ferry logistics can dominate the day if not preplanned.
- Weather shifts quickly on coasts and lakes; keep backup options.
