# Canada Food Guide

## Essential Dishes by Region

| Region | Dish | Notes |
|--------|------|-------|
| Quebec | Poutine | Best in casse-croûtes and classic diners, not novelty-only versions |
| Quebec | Tourtiere | Meat pie, strong in winter/festive menus |
| Montreal | Smoked meat | Sandwich institutions still define the category |
| Ontario | Peameal bacon sandwich | Toronto market classic |
| Atlantic | Lobster roll | Quality varies by freshness and bread balance |
| Atlantic | Seafood chowder | Better in coastal towns than tourist-center chains |
| West Coast | Salmon-focused plates | Look for seasonal preparations |
| BC/West | Spot prawn specials (seasonal) | Limited windows, high demand |
| Nationwide | Butter tarts | Bakery quality matters more than branding |
| Nationwide | Nanaimo bars | Better from independent bakeries than mass retail |

## Reliable Food Cities

### Montreal
Strongest identity-driven dining mix: French bistros, bagel culture, smoked meat, modern tasting rooms.

### Toronto
Most diverse overall. Great for global cuisine density and neighborhood-specific food crawls.

### Vancouver
Excellent seafood, Japanese and pan-Asian depth, plus strong produce-driven kitchens.

## Practical Dining Rules

- Reserve signature restaurants early in peak travel months.
- For value, lunch menus often outperform dinner pricing.
- In top food neighborhoods, walk one or two blocks off the main strip for better quality-price ratio.
- Tipping norms typically land around 15-20% in sit-down service.

## Food Traps to Avoid

1. Social-media-only picks with long lines and average execution.
2. High-rent attraction zones where menu quality is secondary to location.
3. Assuming all "best of" lists age well without seasonal checks.
4. Booking no-reservation weekends in high-demand neighborhoods.
