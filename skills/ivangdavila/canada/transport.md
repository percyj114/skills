# Transport Guide — Canada

## Between Cities

### Flights
- Best for long-distance province jumps
- Build buffer for weather and winter disruptions

### Rail (VIA and regional options)
- Comfortable and scenic on selected routes
- Not always fastest, but often lower-stress

### Car Rental
- Strong for Rockies and some coastal loops
- Winter tires and weather readiness are non-negotiable in cold seasons

## In Cities

### Toronto
- TTC + UP Express make airport and core movement easy

### Vancouver
- SkyTrain + bus network cover most visitor routes efficiently

### Montreal
- Metro plus walking covers core tourism areas well

## Practical Rules

- Use transit in city cores; rent cars for regional segments.
- Avoid same-day long transfer + major activity stacking.
- In mountain routes, fuel early and keep daylight margin.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Underestimating travel times in winter conditions.
2. Driving downtown cores when transit is easier.
3. Skipping shuttle systems where mandatory/recommended.
