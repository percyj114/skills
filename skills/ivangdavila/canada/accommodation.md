# Accommodation Guide — Canada

## Booking Principles

1. Pick fewer bases; avoid one-night chains across long distances.
2. Prioritize transit access in major cities.
3. In park regions, lock logistics first (parking/shuttle constraints).

## Toronto

- **Best convenience:** Financial District / Union access
- **Best local feel:** Queen West edge, Annex-adjacent areas
- **Budget reality:** True budget inventory is limited in core zones

## Vancouver

- **Best convenience:** Downtown near main transit
- **Best value compromise:** Mount Pleasant or Broadway corridor
- **Peak season warning:** Waterfront inventory tightens quickly

## Montreal

- **Best first-time stay:** Old Montreal edge (walkable, but pricier)
- **Best local rhythm:** Plateau or Mile End-adjacent zones
- **Festival periods:** Prices can jump sharply

## Banff and Jasper

- **Banff town:** Most convenient for first timers, expensive in peak season
- **Canmore:** Often better value with short drive tradeoff
- **Jasper:** Smaller inventory, book early for summer

## Hotel vs Apartment

| Style | Best for | Tradeoff |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Hotel | Short stays, high simplicity | Higher nightly cost |
| Apartment | Longer stays, kitchen use | Quality consistency varies |
| Lodge | Nature-first trips | Less flexible dining options nearby |
