# Canada with Kids

## Good Family Bases

| City/Area | Why it works |
|-----------|--------------|
| Toronto | Museums, aquarium, islands, good family logistics |
| Vancouver | Parks, seawall, science options, flexible outdoor choices |
| Montreal | Walkable neighborhoods, food variety, culture density |
| Banff/Canmore | Nature-focused family trips with clear pacing |

## Age-Based Planning

### Ages 3-7
- Short activity blocks
- Park-heavy days with one anchor attraction
- Keep transfer times tight

### Ages 8-12
- Mix interactive museums with light outdoor routes
- Add ferry, bike, or gondola experiences

### Teens
- Neighborhood food walks
- Adventure add-ons (weather and safety dependent)
- Build some free-choice windows in itinerary

## Family Traps to Avoid

1. Overpacking transfer-heavy schedules.
2. Choosing accommodation far from daily activity clusters.
3. Ignoring weather backup plans.
4. Late meal planning in high-demand zones.
