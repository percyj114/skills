# Nightlife Guide — Canada

## Toronto

### Best zones
- **Ossington / Dundas West:** Cocktail bars and mid-size venues
- **King West:** Club-heavy and polished, sometimes style-first
- **Queen West:** Better mix of casual bars and music spots

## Montreal

### Best zones
- **Saint-Laurent corridor:** Dense late-night movement
- **Plateau spots:** Strong bar variety and local rhythm
- **Old Port pockets:** Polished but often pricier

## Vancouver

### Best zones
- **Gastown:** Cocktail-forward, design-driven bars
- **Main Street / Mount Pleasant:** More relaxed neighborhood tone
- **Yaletown:** Upscale but can be inconsistent value

## Practical Notes

- Peak entry windows fill fast on weekends.
- Cover charges vary heavily by event nights.
- Late-night food planning matters after venue close times.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Assuming all cities run on identical nightlife timing.
2. Skipping reservations for high-demand cocktail bars.
3. Planning complicated cross-city venue hopping without transit checks.
