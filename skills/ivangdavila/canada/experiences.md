## Seasonal Experiences

| Season | Good choices |
|--------|--------------|
| Winter | City culture trips + mountain base with weather buffer |
| Spring | Lower crowds in cities, variable mountain conditions |
| Summer | Peak park access, longest days, highest prices |
| Fall | Foliage routes in Ontario/Quebec, strong city-weather balance |

## Advanced Add-ons

- Yukon or northern routes for aurora-focused trips

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Planning fixed outdoor days with no weather fallback.
2. Underestimating transfer fatigue between distant regions.
3. Prioritizing checklist volume over realistic pacing.
