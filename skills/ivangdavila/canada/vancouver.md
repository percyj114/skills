## Attractions That Are Worth It

- **Stanley Park seawall** — still top-tier and best done early morning
- **Granville Island Public Market** — reliable for snack-heavy midday stop
- **Grouse / Sea-to-Sky day options** — choose based on weather and transport comfort

## Better Alternative Tip

Capilano Suspension Bridge is smooth but expensive and crowded in peak windows. For travelers prioritizing nature over packaged attractions, Lynn Canyon offers a lower-cost alternative with less crowd pressure.

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Underestimating rain impact and bringing only one light jacket.
2. Booking mountain day trips with no weather backup plan.
3. Depending only on rideshare in high-demand peak windows.
4. Trying to fit Whistler, downtown, and multiple museums in one day.
