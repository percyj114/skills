# Banff and Jasper Complete Guide

## Core Reality

This is logistics-first travel. Views are extraordinary, but timing, shuttles, weather, and road pacing determine whether the trip is smooth or stressful.

## Banff Base Strategy

**Best for:** Lake Louise, Moraine Lake corridor, shorter iconic hikes, town amenities.

### High-impact plan
- Day 1: Banff town + Bow Falls + Sulphur area
- Day 2: Lake Louise and Moraine Lake using shuttle-first approach
- Day 3: Icefields Parkway partial route or nearby hike

## Jasper Base Strategy

**Best for:** Longer scenic drives, wildlife viewing, darker skies, quieter pace.

### High-impact plan
- Maligne Lake and canyon day
- Valley of the Five Lakes or moderate alternative
- Sunset viewpoints with weather buffer

## Icefields Parkway (Banff-Jasper Route)

- One of the most scenic drives in North America
- Build in photo and stop time; do not treat it as a fast transfer
- Fuel and food options are sparse compared with city standards

## Accommodation Reality

- Peak summer prices are high and inventory tight
- Shoulder season offers better value but more variable weather
- Book flexible options when possible in case conditions shift

## Mistakes to Avoid

1. Driving long mountain routes without weather checks.
2. Assuming parking will be available at top lakes in peak season.
3. Overpacking one day with multiple major hikes and long transfer legs.
4. Ignoring altitude, hydration, and fast weather changes.
