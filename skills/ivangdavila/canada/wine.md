# Canada Wine Guide

## Main Wine Regions

| Region | What to Expect |
|--------|----------------|
| Okanagan Valley (BC) | Most established destination-scale wine route, broad variety |
| Niagara Peninsula (Ontario) | Strong visitor infrastructure, icewine legacy, easy from Toronto |
| Prince Edward County (Ontario) | Smaller producers, cool-climate profile, weekend-trip friendly |
| Nova Scotia | Sparkling momentum and coastal-influenced styles |

## Notable Styles

- Cool-climate whites and sparkling styles are often stronger than expected.

- Many top wineries now focus on food pairing and full tasting experiences.

## Planning Tips
