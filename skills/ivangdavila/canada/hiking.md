# Hiking Guide — Canada

## Core Rule

Choose hikes by season, current conditions, and realistic fitness, not just photos.

## Strong Options by Region

### Rockies
- **Plain of Six Glaciers (Banff area)** — classic views, timing matters
- **Larch Valley windows (seasonal)** — high demand in fall color period

### Vancouver/BC
- **St. Mark's Summit / similar day hikes** — weather-sensitive, strong reward-to-effort
- **Garibaldi / Sea-to-Sky corridor options** — require early starts and forecast checks

### Atlantic
- **Skyline Trail (Cape Breton)** — accessible scenic payoff
- **Gros Morne routes** — varied difficulty and terrain types

## Safety Basics

- Start earlier than you think in mountain regions.
- Carry layers, water, and offline map backup.
- Respect trail closures and wildlife guidance.
- Do not chase summit goals in unstable weather.

## Common Mistakes

1. Late starts leading to dark returns.
2. Inadequate footwear for wet or rocky terrain.
3. No bear-aware preparation in relevant regions.
4. Copying social content routes without condition checks.
