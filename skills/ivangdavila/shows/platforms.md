# Streaming Platforms

## Tracking Where to Watch

For each item, note the platform(s) where it's available:
- Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, Apple TV+, Prime Video, Hulu, Paramount+, Peacock
- Also: rental (iTunes, Google Play), theater, physical media

### Platform Changes

Content moves between platforms. When tracking:
- Note the platform at time of adding
- User may need to re-verify before watching
- Alert if content is "leaving soon" and on watchlist

---

## Multi-Platform Users

If user mentions having multiple subscriptions:
- Prioritize suggesting from platforms they have
- Note platform in watchlist for quick access
- Surface "available on your platforms" vs "would need rental"

## Finding Where to Watch

When user asks "where can I watch X?":
1. Check if we have platform noted from when it was added
2. Suggest checking JustWatch or similar aggregator
3. Note: availability varies by region

**Don't promise availability**—platforms change constantly. Always frame as "last known" or suggest user verify.

## Regional Considerations

- Same streaming service has different libraries by country
- If user mentions location, note for future suggestions
- VPN users may have access to other regions
