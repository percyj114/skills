# Memory Template — Font Awesome

This skill doesn't require persistent memory. Icon preferences can be noted in the user's main workspace memory if they have consistent preferences.

## Optional: User Preferences

If the user expresses preferences, add to their main `MEMORY.md`:

```markdown
## Font Awesome Preferences
- Style: prefers regular over solid
- Method: uses npm (@fortawesome/fontawesome-free)
- Version: v6
```

## Status Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Not needed | No persistent memory required |
| In main memory | Preferences stored in user's workspace |
