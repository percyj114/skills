# ChatGPT Exporter Ultimate

Your entire ChatGPT history, exported in seconds — not tomorrow.

## What You Get

- **Every conversation.** Projects, chats, timestamps, roles, metadata. Nothing left behind.
- **Instant.** No 24-hour wait. No email with a ZIP of cryptic JSON. Just your data, now.
- **Context preserved.** Conversations stay readable. Who said what, when, and why — all intact.

## How It Works

Install the skill. Run it. Get your full export. That's it.

ChatGPT's built-in export makes you wait a day and hands you raw JSON. This skill respects your time.

**Won't:** email you a ZIP file 24 hours later like you requested declassified government documents.
