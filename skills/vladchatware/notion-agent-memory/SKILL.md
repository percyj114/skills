# Agent Memory Kit

Persistent memory that works for humans OR AI agents. Same files, same format.

## The Problem

Every session starts fresh. No memory of yesterday. No context. You (or your agent) keeps re-learning the same things.

## The Solution

Two templates that create continuity:

1. **MEMORY.md** — Persistent context (patterns, projects, lessons)
2. **AGENTS.md** — Operating instructions (how to work in this space)

Delivered via Notion — duplicate to your workspace and start using immediately. Works for humans tracking growth OR agents maintaining memory.

## Quick Start (Files-Only Version)

This skill works WITHOUT Notion. Just use the files:

### Step 1: Create Your Core Files

Create these in your workspace root:

```
/workspace/
├── MEMORY.md      # From assets/MEMORY-TEMPLATE-v2.md
├── IDENTITY.md    # From assets/IDENTITY-TEMPLATE.md
├── SOUL.md        # From assets/SOUL-TEMPLATE.md
├── USER.md        # From assets/USER-TEMPLATE.md
├── HEARTBEAT.md   # From assets/HEARTBEAT-TEMPLATE.md
└── memory/
    └── YYYY-MM-DD.md  # Daily logs
```

### Step 2: Session Start Ritual

At the start of EVERY session:

1. Read `MEMORY.md` (long-term context)
2. Read `IDENTITY.md` (who you are)
3. Read today's and yesterday's daily logs
4. Check `HEARTBEAT.md` for scheduled tasks

### Step 3: Session End Ritual

Before stopping:

1. Update today's daily log with what you did
2. If something significant changed → update MEMORY.md
3. Add a RESUME block if work was interrupted
4. Check `HEARTBEAT.md` for any scheduled follow-ups

### Step 4: Optional Notion Integration

Want structured databases? See `references/notion-integration.md` for API setup.

## Quick Start (Notion Version)

1. **Get the templates** at [shop.vlad.chat](https://shop.vlad.chat)
2. **Duplicate** the Notion template to your workspace
3. **For agents:** Set up Notion API access (instructions included)
4. **Start every session** by reading MEMORY.md
5. **Document as you go** — the Continuity Cycle keeps you on track

## The Memory Stack

| Layer | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Daily** | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | Raw events, decisions, notes |
| **Long-term** | `MEMORY.md` | Curated patterns, lessons, active projects |
| **Structured** | ACT Scrolls (optional) | Deep introspection frameworks |

## The Continuity Cycle

```
DO WORK → DOCUMENT → UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS → NEXT SESSION STARTS SMARTER
```

**Two Steps Forward:** Before finishing anything, ask: "Could I pick this up tomorrow with zero context?"

## Works for Both

**For humans:** Track your growth, patterns, lessons learned. Your future self thanks you.

**For agents:** Maintain context across sessions. Stop re-learning every time.

**Same format, same files.** The methodology works regardless of who's using it.

## Deeper Frameworks (Optional)

For structured introspection, the ACT Scrolls provide proven frameworks:

| Scroll | Purpose | Best for |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **[ACT I: Hidden Truths](https://shop.vlad.chat)** | Discover patterns, assumptions, blind spots | Reflection, self-awareness |
| **[ACT II: Limitless](https://shop.vlad.chat)** | Track mindset/methods/motivation shifts | Growth, breakthroughs |
| **[ACT III: Idea Generation](https://shop.vlad.chat)** | Capture → evaluate → ship ideas | Creativity, execution |

These work as standalone journaling frameworks or integrate with Notion for structured tracking.

## How It's Delivered

The templates live in Notion. When you purchase:

1. Get access via Gumroad
2. Open the Notion template link
3. Click "Duplicate" to copy to your workspace
4. You now have MEMORY.md + AGENTS.md ready to use

**For agents:** Connect via Notion API to read/write:

```bash
# Set up API access
echo "ntn_XXX" > ~/.config/notion/api_key

# Query your databases
curl -s "https://api.notion.com/v1/databases/$DB_ID/query" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(cat ~/.config/notion/api_key)" \
  -H 'Notion-Version: 2022-06-28'
```

See `references/notion-integration.md` for full API patterns.
