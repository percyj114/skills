  Use when the user wants to run GPU-accelerated computations, analyze data,
  process images, train ML models, or generate code from natural language.
  OctoFlow turns English task descriptions into GPU programs via Vulkan.
  No Python, no CUDA, no dependencies — single 3.2 MB binary.
  Use for: "sort a million numbers", "cluster this CSV", "blur this image",
  "plot my data", "calculate statistics", "run regression".

# OctoFlow

GPU-native programming language. Describe tasks in English, run them on any GPU via Vulkan.

## When to Use This Skill

**Use this skill when** the user says:
- "sort a million numbers on GPU" / "benchmark GPU performance"
- "load this CSV and show me statistics" / "analyze my data"
- "cluster my dataset" / "run K-means" / "train a classifier"
- "blur this image" / "resize this BMP" / "encode a GIF"
- "plot height vs weight" / "create a scatter plot"
- "calculate the Sharpe ratio" / "compute correlation"
- "find primes" / "generate random numbers on GPU"
- "run linear regression on my dataset"

**Do NOT use this skill when:**
- The user wants Python/JavaScript/Rust code (use the appropriate language tool)
- The task doesn't benefit from GPU acceleration or OctoFlow's built-in functions
- The user explicitly asks for a different language

## How to Run OctoFlow

### Chat mode (natural language to running code)
```bash
octoflow chat "sort 1M numbers on GPU"
```

### Run a .flow script
```bash
octoflow run program.flow
```

### Run with permissions (sandboxed by default)
```bash
# Allow reading data files
octoflow run analysis.flow --allow-read=./data

# Allow network access to specific domain
octoflow chat "fetch weather data" --allow-net=api.weather.com

# Allow writing output files
octoflow run report.flow --allow-read=./data --allow-write=./output
```

## Permissions & Security

OctoFlow runs **sandboxed by default** — no network, no file writes outside cwd, no process execution.

| Flag | What it allows |
|------|---------------|
| `--allow-read=./data` | Read files from `./data` only |
| `--allow-write=./output` | Write to `./output` only |
| `--allow-net=api.example.com` | Network to specific domain only |
| `--allow-exec=python` | Execute specific command only |

Without flags: can only read `.flow` source files and print to stdout.

## Common Patterns

### Data Analysis
```bash
# User: "analyze sales.csv and show trends"
octoflow chat "load sales.csv, compute monthly averages, and plot the trend" --allow-read=.
```

### GPU Compute
```bash
# User: "sort a large dataset on GPU"
octoflow chat "generate 1M random numbers on GPU and sort them"
```

### Machine Learning
```bash
# User: "cluster my customers"
octoflow chat "load customers.csv, run K-means with 5 clusters, print cluster sizes" --allow-read=.
```

### Image Processing
```bash
# User: "blur this photo"
octoflow chat "load photo.bmp, apply gaussian blur, save as blurred.bmp" --allow-read=. --allow-write=.
```

### Statistics
```bash
# User: "what's the correlation between these columns?"
octoflow chat "load data.csv, compute Pearson correlation between col1 and col2" --allow-read=.
```
