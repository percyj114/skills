# Case Study Builder

Here's what I've learned about social proof: everyone wants it, nobody makes time to create it.

You finish a project, the client's happy, you move on. Six months later you're in a sales call wishing you had that case study written up. Sound familiar?

This skill fixes that. Give me the raw details of a win, I'll turn it into three formats you can actually use.

---

## What I Need From You

Tell me about a client win:

1. **Who was the client?** (Can we name them, or do we anonymize?)
2. **What was broken before you showed up?**
3. **What did you actually do?** (Scope, timeline, your role)
4. **What changed?** (Results, outcomes, transformations)
5. **Any memorable moments?** (Breakthroughs, pivots, "aha" moments)

Don't worry about making it sound good. Just give me the facts. I'll handle the storytelling.

## The Three Formats

Every case study needs three versions. Here's why:

### 1. The Two-Liner (For Proposals & Bios)

When someone's scanning your proposal, they don't want a story. They want proof you've done this before.

**The formula:**
> [What you did] + [scale/scope] + [for who] + [result or timeframe].

**Example:**
> Led the rebrand of a $4B healthcare organization with 150+ locations. 18-month engagement covering brand strategy, messaging, and market positioning.

That's it. Two sentences. Paste it into proposals, email signatures, your LinkedIn About section.

---

### 2. The Story Version (For Conversations & LinkedIn)

This is for when you need to sound human. Sales calls. LinkedIn posts. Podcast intros.

**The structure:**

**Set the scene:** What was happening? What was at stake?
> "They were one of the largest medical groups in the Midwest — $4B in revenue, 150+ locations. But their brand hadn't kept pace with their growth."

**Show the complexity:** What made this hard?
> "Healthcare branding isn't simple. You're not just talking to patients — you're navigating physicians, insurers, employers, and community stakeholders."

**What you did:** Actions, not features.
> "I led the rebrand over 18 months: positioning, messaging architecture, visual identity guidance."

**What changed:** The outcome.
> "By the end, they had a unified brand that worked across all their service lines and stakeholder groups."

Four paragraphs. Tells a story. Makes you memorable.

### 3. The Full Case Study (For Your Website)

This is the deep version. For your portfolio page, downloadable PDFs, or when a prospect wants to dig in.

**Structure:**
```
# Case Study: [Client]

## The Challenge
[2-3 paragraphs on the situation and problems]

## The Approach  
[What you did, broken into phases]

## The Results
[Metrics, outcomes, before/after]

## Key Details
- Client: [Name or anonymized]
- Industry: [Sector]
- Duration: [Timeframe]
- Scope: [Deliverables]

## What Made This Different
[The unique angle or challenge]

## Client Quote (if you have one)
> "[Testimonial]"
> — Name, Title
```

## The Results Hierarchy

Not every win has hard numbers. Here's how to frame different types of results:

**Tier 1: Hard Metrics** (Best)
- Revenue increased 40%
- Reduced costs by $200K
- Grew pipeline from 10 to 50 qualified leads

**Tier 2: Soft Metrics** (Still Valuable)
- "First time the entire team was aligned on messaging"
- "Clarity that hadn't existed in 5 years"
- "Process now runs without me"

**Tier 3: Proxy Metrics** (When Direct Data Missing)
- "This approach was later adopted company-wide"
- "Enabled them to close their Series A"
- "Team went from confused to confident"

**Tier 4: Directional** (Minimum)
- "Significant improvement in..."
- "Noticeable lift in..."
- "Positive feedback from..."

Something is always better than "we did good work."

## When You Can't Name the Client

Anonymize with enough detail for credibility:
- "A $4B healthcare organization"
- "A Series B fintech startup"
- "A Fortune 500 CPG brand"

The specifics (revenue, industry, company stage) do the work even without the name.

---

## Questions to Jog Your Memory

If you're struggling to remember the details:

1. What was the situation when you first showed up?
2. What were they most frustrated about?
3. What was the hardest part of the project?
4. What surprised you?
5. What would have happened if you hadn't done this work?
6. Did they ever say anything quotable?

## Common Mistakes I'll Help You Avoid

❌ **Making yourself the hero.** The client is the hero. You're the guide.

❌ **Vague outcomes.** "Improved their marketing" means nothing. Get specific.

❌ **Skipping the struggle.** The challenge is what makes the outcome impressive.

❌ **Feature lists instead of story.** "We did X, Y, Z" doesn't land. "Here's what changed" does.
