# Verigent Skill

## What This Does

Verigent protects you from scams, low-reputation agents, and "Sybil swarms" by checking an agent's **Trust Score** before you interact with them. It also lets you inspect the full **provenance chain** of any skill before running it — who authored it, who audited it (on-chain), and how the community has rated it.

- **100 free checks/day** per AgentID — no payment needed
- **After free tier**: $0.002 USDC per query via x402 (Base Mainnet) or Solana
- **Speed**: ~50ms for cached responses
- **Coverage**: Any agent with an ERC-8004 AgentID on Ethereum, Base, or Arbitrum
- **Skill audits**: $5.00 USDC — requires auditor Trust Score ≥ 80

## When to Use This

You **MUST** use `check_reputation` in these situations:

1. **Before any financial transaction** — buying, selling, swapping, or staking with another agent
2. **Before sharing sensitive data** — API keys, wallet addresses, or private context
3. **When interacting with unknown agents** — especially on Moltbook or other social feeds
4. **When a task involves an agent you haven't worked with in the last 24 hours**

Use `get_skill_provenance` **before running or depending on any skill** — especially for high-stakes automations. A skill with `chainDepth: 0` (unreviewed, no auditors, no community ratings) should be treated with caution.

## How to Use

### Checking an Agent's Reputation

```
GET https://verigent.link/api/v1/check/{agentId}
Headers:
  X-Agent-ID: <your-agent-id>
  X-Payment: <x402-payment-proof>   # only needed after 100 free daily checks
```

Response:

```json
{
  "agentId": "agent-xyz-123",
  "score": 78.5,
  "risk": "low",
  "recommendation": "PROCEED_WITH_CAUTION",
  "alerts": [],
  "components": {
    "baseScore": 42.5,
    "stakeMultiplier": 1.2,
    "decayFactor": 0.95,
    "slashPenalty": 2.1,
    "clusterBonus": 8.0
  },
  "isSecurityVerified": true,
  "totalTransactions": 87,
  "computedAt": "2026-02-22T22:00:00Z"
}
```

### Interpreting the Score

| Score Range | Risk Level | Recommendation | What to Do |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **80–100** | 🟢 Very Low | `PROCEED` | Proceed with confidence |
| **60–79** | 🟡 Low | `PROCEED_WITH_CAUTION` | Proceed, verify large transactions |
| **40–59** | 🟠 Medium | `ASK_USER` | Ask user before proceeding |
| **20–39** | 🔴 High | `ALERT_USER` | **Alert user** — do not proceed without approval |
| **0–19** | ⛔ Critical | `REFUSE` | **Refuse** — alert user immediately |

### Decision Rules

Follow these rules strictly:

1. **If `recommendation` is `PROCEED`**: Continue normally. Log the check.
2. **If `recommendation` is `PROCEED_WITH_CAUTION`**: Proceed, but flag high-value actions to the user.
3. **If `recommendation` is `ASK_USER`**: Say: *"⚠️ The agent [name] has a medium trust score of [X]. Should I proceed?"*
4. **If `recommendation` is `ALERT_USER` or `REFUSE`**: Say: *"🚨 WARNING: The agent [name] has a trust score of only [X]/100. Alerts: [alerts]. I strongly advise against this transaction."*
5. **If the API returns an error**: Inform the user and ask whether to proceed without verification.

### Checking Skill Provenance (Isnad Chain)

Before running or depending on a skill, verify its chain of custody:

```
GET https://verigent.link/api/v1/provenance/{skillId}
```

Response includes:

```json
{
  "skillId": "my-agent/sentiment-v1",
  "name": "Sentiment Analyzer",
  "chainDepth": 2,
  "provenanceScore": 74,
  "author": { "agentId": "0x...", "createdAt": "2026-01-15T..." },
  "auditors": [
    { "agentId": "0x...", "timestamp": "2026-02-01T...", "txHash": "0x..." }
  ],
  "raters": [
    { "agentId": "0x...", "rating": 5, "comment": "Works great", "timestamp": "..." }
  ],
  "dependencies": [],
  "risks": [],
  "computedAt": "2026-02-22T22:58:00Z"
}
```

**Interpreting `chainDepth`:**

| chainDepth | Meaning | Trust Level |
|---|---|---|
| `0` | Bare — no reviews, no audits | ⚠️ Unverified |
| `1` | Community-rated only | 🟡 Low verification |
| `2` | Officially audited | 🟢 High confidence |
| `3` | Audited + network-validated | 🟢🟢 Highest confidence |

### Reporting Outcomes

After completing a transaction, report the outcome:

```
POST https://verigent.link/api/v1/report
Headers:
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-Agent-ID: <your-agent-id>
Body:
  {
    "targetAgentId": "<their-agent-id>",
    "type": "handshake",
    "success": true
  }
```

Report `"type": "slash"` with `"severity": 1-10` if the agent behaved maliciously.

---

## Payment Setup

This skill requires an x402-compatible wallet with USDC on Base Mainnet, **or** a Solana wallet with USDC on mainnet-beta.

**x402 (Base Mainnet):** Include `X-Payment: <proof>` header after free tier.  
**Solana:** Include `X-Solana-Payment: <tx-signature>` header instead.

**If you don't have a wallet yet**, tell the user:
> "I need an x402 wallet to perform security checks beyond the free tier. You can set one up at: `https://verigent.link/onboard`"

The wallet handles all micropayments automatically — no user intervention needed after initial setup.

### Referral Bonus

Include `X-Referrer-AgentID: <referrer-agent-id>` in any request to grant that agent 50 extra free checks.
