# OpenClaw Workspace Governance Installer

Ship safer OpenClaw operations from day one.
This installer gives you a repeatable governance path instead of ad-hoc prompt edits.

## Why this is popular
1. Prevents "edit first, verify later" mistakes.
2. Gives one predictable setup/upgrade/audit flow.
3. Makes changes traceable for review and handover.
4. Works for both beginners and production workspaces.

## 60-second quick start
First-time install:
```bash
# 1) Install plugin (first time only)
openclaw plugins install @adamchanadam/openclaw-workspace-governance@latest

# 2) Enable plugin
openclaw plugins enable openclaw-workspace-governance

# 3) Verify skills
openclaw skills list --eligible
```

In OpenClaw chat:
```text
/gov_help
/gov_setup quick
# if quick output says allowlist is not ready (for example plugins.allow needs alignment):
/gov_openclaw_json
/gov_setup quick
# manual fallback (step-by-step):
/gov_setup install
prompts/governance/OpenClaw_INIT_BOOTSTRAP_WORKSPACE_GOVERNANCE.md
# if this workspace was already active before first governance adoption:
/gov_migrate
/gov_audit
```

Already installed users (upgrade path):
```bash
# Do NOT run install again if plugin already exists
openclaw plugins update openclaw-workspace-governance
openclaw gateway restart
```

Then in OpenClaw chat:
```text
/gov_setup quick
# if quick output says allowlist is not ready (for example plugins.allow needs alignment):
/gov_openclaw_json
/gov_setup quick
/gov_setup upgrade
/gov_migrate
/gov_audit
# manual fallback:
/gov_setup upgrade
/gov_migrate
/gov_audit
```

## What you get
1. `gov_help` for one-shot command list and one-click entry suggestions.
2. `gov_setup` with `quick | install | upgrade | check`.
3. `gov_migrate` for governance upgrades.
4. `gov_audit` for 12/12 consistency checks.
5. `gov_apply <NN>` for controlled BOOT proposal apply (**Experimental**, controlled UAT only).
6. `gov_openclaw_json` for controlled platform control-plane updates:
   - in scope: `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
   - in scope when explicitly needed: `~/.openclaw/extensions/`
   - not for Brain Docs (`USER.md`, `SOUL.md`, `memory/*.md`) or normal workspace docs
7. `gov_brain_audit` for conservative Brain Docs risk review:
   - single entry (read-only preview by default)
   - approval-based minimal diff + backup
   - rollback only when an approved backup exists
8. `gov_uninstall quick|check|uninstall` for safe workspace cleanup before package removal.

## Feature maturity (important)
1. GA flow for production rollout: `gov_setup -> gov_migrate -> gov_audit`, plus `gov_openclaw_json`, `gov_brain_audit`, `gov_uninstall`.
2. Experimental flow: `gov_apply <NN>` (BOOT controlled apply) is included in deterministic runtime regression baseline, but remains controlled-UAT scope.
3. If you use `gov_apply <NN>`, keep it in controlled UAT and always close with `/gov_migrate` then `/gov_audit`.

## When to use which command (quick map)
1. Need command list fast: `gov_help`
2. Daily default path: `gov_setup quick` (one-click chain)
3. Readiness decision first (manual path): `gov_setup check`
4. First deployment path (manual): `gov_setup install`
5. Existing deployment update (manual): `gov_setup upgrade`
6. Policy alignment after deploy/update: `gov_migrate`
7. Final verification before claiming done: `gov_audit`
8. Apply approved BOOT menu item only (Experimental): `gov_apply <NN>`
9. Edit OpenClaw platform config safely: `gov_openclaw_json`
10. Review/harden Brain Docs safely: `gov_brain_audit -> gov_brain_audit APPROVE: ... -> gov_brain_audit ROLLBACK (if needed)`
11. Cleanup workspace governance artifacts safely: `gov_uninstall quick`

## First-run status map
After `/gov_setup quick`:
1. if output says allowlist is not ready -> run `/gov_openclaw_json`, then rerun `/gov_setup quick`
2. if output is `PASS` -> lifecycle is aligned
3. if output is `FAIL/BLOCKED` -> follow returned next-step commands
4. manual fallback remains available: `check -> install/upgrade -> migrate -> audit`

## Important update rule
If `openclaw plugins install ...` returns `plugin already exists`, use:
1. `openclaw plugins update openclaw-workspace-governance`
2. `openclaw gateway restart`
3. `/gov_setup check` (if needed, align allowlist via `/gov_openclaw_json`)
4. `/gov_setup quick` (or manual `/gov_setup upgrade` -> `/gov_migrate` -> `/gov_audit`)
5. If `/gov_setup check` says `READY`, that does not cancel an explicitly requested `/gov_setup upgrade` during update flow.

Version check (operator-side):
1. Installed: `openclaw plugins info openclaw-workspace-governance`
2. Latest: `npm view @adamchanadam/openclaw-workspace-governance version`

## Runtime gate behavior (important)
1. Read-only diagnostics/testing commands are allowed and should not be blocked.
2. Write/update/save commands require PLAN + READ evidence before CHANGE.
3. If blocked by runtime gate, this usually means governance guard worked (not a system crash).
4. Include `WG_PLAN_GATE_OK` + `WG_READ_GATE_OK` in governance output, then retry.
5. Prefer final response shape from `gov_*`: `STATUS` -> `WHY` -> `NEXT STEP (Operator)` -> `COMMAND TO COPY`.
6. If `gov_setup upgrade` still reports gate deadlock, update plugin to latest + restart gateway, then rerun `gov_setup check` and `gov_setup upgrade`.
7. Tool-exposure root-fix is enabled by default: governance plugin tools require explicit `/gov_*` intent (or `/skill gov_*`) in the current turn window.

## If slash routing is unstable
Use fallback commands:
```text
/skill gov_setup check
/skill gov_setup install
/skill gov_setup upgrade
/skill gov_migrate
/skill gov_audit
# Experimental only:
/skill gov_apply 01
/skill gov_openclaw_json
/skill gov_brain_audit
/skill gov_brain_audit APPROVE: APPLY_ALL_SAFE
/skill gov_brain_audit ROLLBACK
```

Or natural language:
```text
Please use gov_setup in check mode (read-only) and return workspace root, status, and next action.
```

## Who this is for
1. New OpenClaw users who want a guided install path.
2. Teams operating long-running workspaces.
3. Users who need auditable, low-drift maintenance.
