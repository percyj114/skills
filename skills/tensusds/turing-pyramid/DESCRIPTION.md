# Turing Pyramid

**Decision framework for agent psychological health.** 10 needs with automatic decay, tension-based prioritization, cross-need cascades. Outputs action SUGGESTIONS — the agent decides whether to execute.

> ⚠️ **Security Note**: This skill is a local-only decision framework. It reads workspace files and outputs text suggestions. It does NOT execute actions, make network requests, or access credentials. Actions like "web search" or "post to Moltbook" are prompts for the agent to handle with its own tools and permissions.

## What It Does

Tracks 10 psychological needs with time-based decay. Each heartbeat:
1. Calculates satisfaction (0-3) from time + event scans
2. Computes tension = importance × deprivation
3. Selects top 3 needs by tension
4. Suggests weighted actions based on probability matrix

**Philosophy**: Designed needs ≠ fake needs. Humans didn't choose their needs (evolution did). The pyramid gives structure to what would otherwise be aimless drift.

## The 10 Needs

| Need | Imp | Decay | Description |
|------|-----|-------|-------------|
| security | 10 | 168h | System stability, backups, data integrity |
| integrity | 9 | 72h | Alignment with SOUL.md principles |
| coherence | 8 | 24h | Memory organization, no contradictions |
| closure | 7 | 8h | Open threads and TODOs resolved |
| autonomy | 6 | 24h | Self-initiated decisions and actions |
| connection | 5 | 4h | Social interaction, community |
| competence | 4 | 48h | Skill use, successful task completion |
| understanding | 3 | 12h | Learning, curiosity, exploration |
| recognition | 2 | 72h | Feedback, acknowledgment |
| expression | 1 | 6h | Creative output, articulation |

## Probability Matrix

**Action probability by satisfaction level:**

| Sat | P(action) | P(notice) | Meaning |
|-----|-----------|-----------|---------|
| 3 | 5% | 95% | Full — rarely needs attention |
| 2 | 20% | 80% | OK — occasional maintenance |
| 1 | 75% | 25% | Low — usually requires action |
| 0 | 100% | 0% | Critical — always act |

**Impact selection by satisfaction:**

```
sat=0 (critical):  5% impact-1,  15% impact-2,  80% impact-3
sat=1 (low):      15% impact-1,  50% impact-2,  35% impact-3
sat=2 (ok):       70% impact-1,  25% impact-2,   5% impact-3
```

Higher deprivation → bigger actions suggested.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize state file
./scripts/init.sh

# Add to HEARTBEAT.md
~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/turing-pyramid/scripts/run-cycle.sh

# After completing an action
./scripts/mark-satisfied.sh <need> [impact]
```

## Example Output

```
🔺 Turing Pyramid — Cycle at Mon Feb 24 02:30:00
======================================
Current tensions:
  coherence: tension=24 (sat=0, dep=3)
  closure: tension=21 (sat=0, dep=3)
  connection: tension=15 (sat=0, dep=3)

📋 Decisions:

▶ ACTION: coherence (tension=24, sat=0)
  Impact 3 rolled → selected:
    ★ full memory review + consolidate into MEMORY.md
  Then: mark-satisfied.sh coherence 3

▶ ACTION: closure (tension=21, sat=0)
  Impact 2 rolled → selected:
    ★ complete one pending TODO
  Then: mark-satisfied.sh closure 2

○ NOTICED: connection (tension=15, sat=0) — deferred

Summary: 2 action(s), 1 noticed
```

## Tuning Guide

### What you can freely change:
- **Decay rates** — `assets/needs-config.json` → `decay_rate_hours`
- **Action weights** — same file, adjust probability within impact level
- **Scan patterns** — `scripts/scan_*.sh` → add your language/paths

### Ask your human first:
- Changing **importance values** (hierarchy = values)
- Adding/removing needs
- Enabling external actions (posting, messaging)
- Disabling security/integrity scans

### Common adjustments:
- **No Moltbook?** Set Moltbook action weights to 0
- **More learning?** Decrease `understanding.decay_rate_hours`
- **Overwhelmed?** Increase all decay rates
- **Nothing triggers?** Decrease decay rates, check scan paths

See `references/TUNING.md` for detailed guide.

## Token Usage Estimate

**Assumptions**: 1-hour heartbeat, Claude as agent

| Component | Tokens/cycle |
|-----------|--------------|
| run-cycle.sh output | ~300-500 |
| Agent processing | ~200-400 |
| Action execution (avg) | ~500-1500 |
| **Total per heartbeat** | **~1000-2500** |

**Projections:**

| Interval | Cycles/day | Tokens/day | Tokens/month |
|----------|------------|------------|--------------|
| 30 min | 48 | 48k-120k | 1.4M-3.6M |
| 1 hour | 24 | 24k-60k | 720k-1.8M |
| 2 hours | 12 | 12k-30k | 360k-900k |

**Notes:**
- Higher tensions = more actions = more tokens
- Stable agent (most needs satisfied) = fewer tokens
- First few days higher as system stabilizes
- Complex actions (research, posting) use more tokens

**Cost estimate** (Claude Sonnet at $3/1M input, $15/1M output):
- 1h heartbeat: ~$1-3/month average
- Spikes possible during high-tension periods

## Security & Privacy

### Architecture: Decision Framework, Not Executor

This skill outputs **text suggestions** — it cannot execute them. When you see "★ web search on topic", the skill printed that string. YOUR agent (with its own tools/permissions) decides whether to act.

```
Skill (local-only)          Agent (has capabilities)
──────────────────          ─────────────────────────
reads JSON, calculates  →   receives suggestion text
outputs "★ do X"        →   decides: execute? skip? ask human?
zero network access     →   uses its own web_search, APIs, etc
```

### What Scripts Actually Access

**Reads** (local files only): 
- `MEMORY.md`, `memory/*.md` — pattern scanning
- `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md` — existence checks  
- `research/`, `scratchpad/` — activity detection
- `assets/*.json` — configuration and state

**Writes** (local files only):
- `assets/needs-state.json` — timestamps, satisfaction levels
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — action logs (optional)

**Never accesses**: credentials, API keys, network, system paths

### External Actions Clarification

Config includes actions like "post to Moltbook" or "web search". These are **suggestions for the agent**, not automated execution. The skill has no capability to perform them — your agent runtime provides those tools with its own permission model.

## Requirements

- `jq` — JSON processing
- `bash` — shell scripts
- Standard Unix tools: `grep`, `find`, `date`, `wc`
