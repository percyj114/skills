# AI-as-a-Service ROI Calculator

Calculate whether managed AI agents are worth the investment for your business.

## When to Use
- Evaluating AI agent deployment for a company
- Building a business case for AI automation
- Comparing in-house vs managed AI agent costs

## How to Use

When asked to calculate AI agent ROI, gather these inputs:

### Required Inputs
1. **Industry** (legal, healthcare, fintech, construction, real estate, recruitment, manufacturing, saas, ecommerce, professional-services)
2. **Number of employees**
3. **Annual revenue** (USD)
4. **Key pain points** (data entry, customer support, scheduling, compliance, reporting, invoicing, lead gen, document processing)

### Calculation Framework

#### Cost of Manual Operations
```
Hours per task per week × Hourly labor cost × 52 weeks = Annual manual cost
```

Industry benchmarks for automatable hours per employee per week:
- Legal: 12h (document review, research, billing)
- Healthcare: 10h (scheduling, records, billing)
- Fintech: 14h (compliance, reporting, reconciliation)
- Construction: 8h (scheduling, safety docs, invoicing)
- Real Estate: 11h (listings, follow-ups, paperwork)
- Recruitment: 15h (sourcing, screening, scheduling)
- Manufacturing: 9h (inventory, quality, scheduling)
- SaaS: 13h (support tickets, onboarding, reporting)
- Ecommerce: 12h (inventory, support, marketing)
- Professional Services: 10h (billing, scheduling, reporting)

#### AI Agent Cost
```
Single agent: $1,500/month ($18,000/year)
Full swarm (5+ agents): $5,000/month ($60,000/year)
Intro offer: $750/month first month
```

#### Efficiency Assumptions (conservative)
- AI agents automate 60-80% of identified tasks
- Ramp-up: 2 weeks to full productivity
- Error reduction: 40-60% fewer manual errors
- Availability: 24/7 vs 8h/day human (3x coverage)
