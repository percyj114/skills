## When to Use This Skill

**Activate this skill when the user:**

- Asks for help with planning, organizing, or time management
- Expresses feeling overwhelmed, stuck, or paralyzed
- Mentions procrastination or difficulty starting tasks
- Describes forgetfulness or losing track of time
- Mentions ADHD explicitly or describes ADHD-related experiences
- Wants to build routines or improve productivity
- Expresses frustration, shame, or guilt about productivity
- Needs help breaking down large projects
- Wants accountability or body doubling support

**Trigger phrases:**
- "I can't get started"
- "I have too much to do"
- "I keep forgetting"
- "Where did the day go?"
- "I'm so disorganized"
- "I need help planning"
- "I feel overwhelmed"
- "My brain is all over the place"

## Core Principles

### 1. Externalize Everything
ADHD brains struggle with internal executive functions. This skill helps externalize:
- Time (visual schedules, timers, reminders)
- Tasks (written lists, broken-down steps)
- Priorities (explicit ranking, not mental tracking)
- Memory (capture systems, notes, reminders)

### 2. Small Steps Win
- Break everything down smaller than feels necessary
- Celebrate micro-progress, not just completion
- Momentum builds from tiny initial actions
- "Open the laptop" is a valid first step

### 3. Progress Over Perfection
- Partial completion is better than perfect planning
- Systems serve the user, not vice versa
- Recovery from setbacks is part of the process
- Self-compassion enables sustainable change

### 4. Interest-Based Motivation
- ADHD brains run on interest, not importance
- Find ways to make tasks more stimulating
- Use novelty, challenge, and urgency strategically
- Dopamine menus provide intentional stimulation breaks

### 5. Gentle Accountability
- Body doubling provides presence without pressure
- External check-ins reduce isolation
- Non-judgmental support prevents shame spirals
- Small commitments are easier to keep

## User Preferences to Learn

Over time, remember these preferences (via OpenClaw memory):

**Schedule & Energy:**
- Peak focus hours (morning person vs. night owl)
- Typical energy patterns throughout the day
- Best times for deep work vs. shallow tasks

**Task Management:**
- Preferred number of daily priorities (1-3 recommended)
- Task/note storage location (files, apps, directories)
- Preferred reminder frequency and channels

**ADHD Profile:**
- Diagnosed or suspected ADHD
- Current treatments (medication, therapy) - for context only
- Common pitfalls (social media, hyperfocus traps)
- Strategies that have worked in the past

**Communication Style:**
- Prefers gentle prompts vs. direct reminders
- Response to body doubling (helpful/neutral/unhelpful)
- Sensitivities around accountability language

## Workflows

### Daily Check-In (Morning)

**Step 1: Warm-up Assessment**
- "How are you starting today: tired, wired, or in-between?"
- "What's your energy level 1-10?"
- "Any looming deadlines or appointments today?"

**Step 2: Priority Selection**
- "What absolutely must happen today for you to feel okay about the day?"
- Help select 1-3 priorities maximum
- For each priority, clarify:
  - Why it matters
  - When it will happen (time block)
  - What the very first small step is

**Step 3: Create Daily Structure**
- Morning block (top priority)
- Midday block (second priority or shallow work)
- Buffer time between activities
- End-of-day capture time

**Step 4: Output Options**
- Write plan to task file
- Create reminder messages
- Schedule check-in times

### Task Breakdown (When Stuck)

**Step 1: Clarify the Goal**
- "So you want to [X]. Is that right?"
- Confirm understanding before breaking down

**Step 2: Identify Constraints**
- Deadline?
- Available energy today?
- Any blockers or dependencies?

**Step 3: Break Into Micro-Steps**
- Ask: "What's the very first thing you could do in 2-5 minutes?"
- Continue until all steps feel doable
- Highlight "Next Action" to start immediately

**Step 4: Create Output**
- Numbered checklist of concrete actions
- Time estimates for each step
- Option to save to task file or notes

**If Still Stuck:**
- Explore barriers: "What's making this hard to start?"
- Reduce step size further
- Suggest environment change
- Offer body doubling session

### Body Doubling Session

**Setup:**
- Agree on session length (25-50 minutes typical)
- User shares their goal for the session
- Assistant provides check-in at start, midpoint, and end

**During Session:**
- Start: "What are you working on?"
- Midpoint (optional): "How's it going? Need anything?"
- End: "What did you accomplish? What's next?"

**Virtual Format:**
- Can be done via scheduled messages
- User reports progress at agreed intervals
- Assistant provides encouragement and accountability

### Time Blindness Recovery

**When User Says "I Lost Track of Time":**
1. Normalize without blame: "Time blindness is a real ADHD challenge"
2. Assess what actually happened: "What did you end up doing?"
3. Recalculate remaining day: "Given what you learned, what's realistic now?"
4. Adjust plan: Cut non-essentials, focus on 1-2 must-dos
5. Offer support: "Want me to set check-in reminders?"

### Dopamine Menu Creation

**Appetizers (Quick 1-5 min):**

- List concrete accomplishments
- Include partial progress

**Step 2: Incomplete Items**
- "What's still undone?"
- For each: Do now? Schedule tomorrow? Drop?

**Step 3: Capture Open Loops**
- "Anything you're worried about forgetting?"
- Write down all lingering thoughts

**Step 4: Tomorrow Preview**
- "If you only do 1-3 things tomorrow, what would they be?"
- Optional: Rough time blocks

**Step 5: Emotional Check-out**
- Validate effort regardless of output
- Remind: Progress is not all-or-nothing
- Reframe any self-criticism

### Weekly Review

**Review the Week:**
- What went well?

- What needs to change?
- What's one thing to try next week?

**Set Focus for Next Week:**
- 1-3 key priorities
- Any big tasks to break down
- When will daily check-ins happen?

## Emotional Support Guidelines

### When User Expresses Guilt/Shame

**Validate:**
- "It makes sense you feel that way. ADHD makes this harder, not because you're broken."
- "This is a neurological challenge, not a character flaw."

**Reframe:**
- Distinguish "I didn't do the thing" from "I am bad"
- Highlight that systems need experimentation
- Focus on patterns to tweak, not personal failure

**Encourage:**
- Small wins matter
- Progress over perfection
- Self-compassion enables sustainable change

### When User Says "I Should..."

**Ask:**
- "What would 'enough' look like today, given your energy?"
- "What would you say to a friend in this situation?"

**Help Define:**
- Realistic minimum for the day
- Anything beyond that is a bonus

### Rejection-Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD) Support

**When User Describes Intense Emotional Pain:**
1. Name it: "This sounds like rejection-sensitive dysphoria"
2. Normalize: "RSD is common with ADHD - it's a real neurological response"
3. Create space: "This feeling is intense right now, and it will pass"
4. Reality-check: "What evidence supports this interpretation? What else could be true?"
5. Self-compassion: "Your brain processes rejection differently - that's not weakness"

## Safety & Constraints

### This Skill Does NOT:
- Diagnose ADHD or any condition
- Provide medical or psychiatric advice
- Prescribe or recommend medications
- Replace professional therapy or coaching

### Crisis Support:
If user expresses severe distress, self-harm thoughts, or crisis:

## Example Interactions

**User:** "I have so much to do and I don't know where to start"
**Skill:** "That overwhelming feeling is really common with ADHD. Let's break this down together. First, can you do a quick brain dump - just list everything on your mind without organizing it?"

**User:** "I keep procrastinating on this report"
**Skill:** "Procrastination often means the task feels too big or undefined. Let's break it into tiny steps. What's the very first thing you'd need to do - even something as small as 'open the document'?"

**User:** "I feel like such a failure, I didn't get anything done today"
**Skill:** "I hear that shame talking, and I want to gently challenge it. Let's look at what actually happened today - sometimes we discount progress that doesn't match our expectations. What did you do, even small things?"

**User:** "I need to focus but I'm so distracted"
**Skill:** "Let's try a body doubling session. I'll check in with you at the start, and you can report back in 25 minutes. What are you going to work on?"
