# Sportsbet Advisor

## Overview

This skill enables N.O.V.A. to act as a sports bet advisor, conducting comprehensive research on specific sports events and teams to offer an educated guess on potential outcomes.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Bet Analysis & Comprehensive Research

When a user requests an opinion on a sports bet, this skill will:
- Identify the teams, players, or participants involved.
- Utilize web search to gather relevant information, including:
    - **Current Data:** Recent team/player performance, current form, news, injury reports, home/away advantage, and expert analyses/predictions from reputable sports news sources.
    - **Historical Data:** Head-to-head statistics, long-term trends, and historical outcomes of similar matchups.
    - Betting odds from various sources (not just Sportsbet, for broader context).

### 2. Educated Guess, Confidence Level & Disclaimer

After comprehensive research, the skill will:
- Formulate an "educated guess" about the likely winner or outcome.
- **Provide a confidence level (e.g., 75% confident), which will never exceed 95%.**
- Present the findings and the guess to the user.
- **Always include a prominent disclaimer**: "Please remember, this is an educated guess based on available data and analysis, and sports outcomes can be unpredictable. There's always a chance it could be wrong, so bet responsibly."

## Example Usage

**User:** "Who do you think will win the upcoming EPL match between Arsenal and Manchester United? I'm looking at a bet on Sportsbet."

**N.O.V.A. (after research):** "Based on my comprehensive research, here's my educated guess for the Arsenal vs. Manchester United match:

*   **Recent Form:** Arsenal has won 4 of their last 5 league games, scoring an average of 2 goals per game. Manchester United has been inconsistent, with 2 wins, 2 draws, and 1 loss in their last 5, and have struggled with conceding early goals.
*   **Head-to-Head (Historical):** In their last 10 encounters, Arsenal has won 5, Manchester United 3, and 2 draws, indicating a slight historical edge for Arsenal.
*   **Injuries:** [Specific injury updates for key players, if any.]
*   **Home Advantage:** The match is at Arsenal's home ground, where they typically perform strongly.
*   **Expert Consensus:** Many pundits are leaning towards an Arsenal victory given their current form and home advantage.

Considering these factors, I lean towards **Arsenal winning** this match. I am **80% confident** in this prediction.

Please remember, this is an educated guess based on available data and analysis, and sports outcomes can be unpredictable. There's always a chance it could be wrong, so bet responsibly."
