# CLAWP OpenClaw Skill

CLAWP is an OpenClaw skill used by the ClawPad platform to enable autonomous meme token launches from a single user prompt.

The skill transforms a short token idea into a structured launch blueprint and coordinates execution through predefined system mechanics.

## Purpose

This skill is designed to:
- Generate complete meme token launch blueprints
- Provide naming, narrative, and visual direction
- Coordinate deployment and post-launch buyback and burn actions

CLAWP does not provide investment advice or discretionary financial decisions.

## How It Works

1. A user submits a short idea describing a meme token
2. The agent generates a deterministic launch blueprint
3. Deployment proceeds through fixed execution mechanics
4. Post-launch buyback and burn actions are handled automatically

## Scope and Constraints

- Execution follows predefined rules
- No profit guarantees or financial advice
- Funds are handled by controlled system flows
- The skill operates as part of the ClawPad platform

## Integration

This skill is built for use with the OpenClaw runtime and is intended for submission to the ClawHub registry.
