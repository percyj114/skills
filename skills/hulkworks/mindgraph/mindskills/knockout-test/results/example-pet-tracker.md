# [[Knockout Test]]: Pet Tracker App

## Round 1: Build It Up 💪
- **Pain**: Pet owners worry when pets roam. GPS collars exist but apps are clunky.
- **Market**: 67M US dog owners, $7B pet tech market
- **Money**: $9.99/mo subscription + hardware markup
- **Hook**: "Always know where your pet is"

## Round 2: Tear It Down 👊
- **Competition**: [[Whistle]], [[Fi]], [[Apple AirTag]] — massive players
- **Challenges**: Hardware is expensive to develop, cellular costs eat margins
- **Why it fails**: Apple AirTag at $29 killed the low-end. Fi raised $30M+.

## Round 3: Reality Check 🧐
- **Feature vs Product**: Apple/Google will absorb this into their ecosystems
- **Who pays**: Pet owners, but switching cost from existing tracker is low
- **Distribution**: Pet stores, vets — hard partnerships to crack
- **Moat**: None. Hardware + software combo requires serious capital.

## Round 4: Verdict 🏆
🅿️ **PARK** — Too capital-intensive, dominant players, no clear differentiation.

**What would change my mind**: A software-only angle (e.g., pet health tracking from existing wearable data) that avoids the hardware trap.
