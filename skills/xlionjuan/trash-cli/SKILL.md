# trash-cli

A command line interface to the freedesktop.org trashcan. It trashes files recording the original path, deletion date, and permissions. It uses the same trashcan used by KDE, GNOME, and XFCE.

## Installation

```bash
# Via Homebrew (Linux/macOS)
brew install trash-cli

# Via pip
pip install trash-cli

# Via apt (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install trash-cli

# Via pacman (Arch Linux)
sudo pacman -S trash-cli

# Via dnf (Fedora)
sudo dnf install trash-cli
```

## Commands Overview

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `trash-put` | Move files/directories to trash |
| `trash-list` | List trashed files |
| `trash-restore` | Restore trashed files |
| `trash-empty` | Permanently delete trashed files |
| `trash-rm` | Remove specific files from trash |

## trash-put

Move files or directories to the trash can.

```bash
trash-put <file>           # Trash a file
trash-put <dir>/           # Trash a directory
trash-put -f <file>        # Silently ignore nonexistent files
trash-put -v <file>        # Verbose output
```

### Options

- `-f, --force` - Silently ignore nonexistent files
- `-v, --verbose` - Explain what is being done
- `--trash-dir TRASHDIR` - Use TRASHDIR as trash folder

### Notes

- Unlike `rm`, `trash-put` does not require `-R` for directories
- Files trashed from home partition go to `~/.local/share/Trash/`
- Files from other partitions go to `$partition/.Trash/$uid` or `$partition/.Trash-$uid`

## trash-list

List all trashed files.

```bash
trash-list                          # List all trashed files
trash-list | grep <pattern>         # Search for specific files
trash-list --all-users              # List trashcans of all users
```

### Output Format

```
2008-06-01 10:30:48 /home/user/bar
2008-06-02 21:50:41 /home/user/baz
```

Format: `deletion_date original_path`

## trash-restore

Restore trashed files to their original location.

```bash
trash-restore                       # Interactive restore
trash-restore --overwrite          # Overwrite existing files
trash-restore --sort date          # Sort by date (default)
trash-restore --sort path          # Sort by path
```

### Interactive Mode

```
$ trash-restore
0 2007-08-30 12:36:00 /home/andrea/foo
1 2007-08-30 12:39:41 /home/andrea/bar
2 2007-08-30 12:39:41 /home/andrea/baz
What file to restore [0..2]: 0
```

- Enter the number to restore that file
- Use `0-2,3` to restore multiple files
- Use `--overwrite` to replace existing files

## trash-empty

Permanently remove files from trash.

```bash
trash-empty                 # Remove ALL trashed files
trash-empty 7              # Remove files older than 7 days
trash-empty 1              # Remove files older than 1 day
```

### Examples

```bash
# Delete everything in trash
trash-empty

# Keep only files from the last 7 days
trash-empty 7

# Keep only today's files
trash-empty 1
```

## trash-rm

Remove specific files from trash (by pattern).

```bash
trash-rm <pattern>         # Remove files matching pattern
trash-rm '*.o'             # Remove all .o files
trash-rm foo               # Remove all files named "foo"
trash-rm /full/path        # Remove by original path
```

**Note**: Use quotes to protect pattern from shell expansion.

```bash
trash-rm '*.log'          # Correct
trash-rm *.log            # Wrong - shell will expand
```

## Safety Tips

### Replace rm with trash-put

Add to `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
# Remind yourself not to use rm directly
alias rm='echo "Use trash-put instead!"; false'

# Or use a safer alias
alias rm='trash-put'
```

To bypass the alias when you really need `rm`:

```bash
\rm file.txt
```

### Recovery Workflow

1. Check what's in trash: `trash-list`
2. Find your file: `trash-list | grep <filename>`
3. Restore: `trash-restore`

## Trash Location

- **Home partition**: `~/.local/share/Trash/`
- **Other partitions**: `$mount_point/.Trash/$uid` or `$mount_point/.Trash-$uid`

## Limitations

- Does not support BRTFS volumes
- Cannot trash files from read-only filesystems

## FAQ

### Creating a top-level .Trash directory

If you need to create a trash directory on a different partition:

```bash
sudo mkdir --parent /.Trash
sudo chmod a+rw /.Trash
sudo chmod +t /.Trash
```

### Should I alias rm to trash-put?

**The author advises against this.** Although `trash-put` seems compatible with `rm`, it has different semantics that will cause problems. For example, while `rm` requires `-R` for deleting directories, `trash-put` does not.

Instead, use a warning alias:

```bash
alias rm='echo "This is not the command you are looking for."; false'
```

To bypass when you really need `rm`:

```bash
\rm file.txt
```
