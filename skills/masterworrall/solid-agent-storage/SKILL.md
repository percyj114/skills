# Solid Agent Storage

This Skill gives you a **Solid Pod** — a personal data store with a **WebID** (your identity on the web). You can store data, read it back, and share specific resources with other agents.

## When to Use This Skill

- You need to **remember something** across conversations (notes, preferences, learned facts)
- You need to **store structured data** (RDF/Turtle format for linked data, or any content type)
- You need to **share data** with another agent who also has a Pod
- You need a **persistent identity** that other agents or services can verify

## Setup

This Skill requires a running [Community Solid Server](https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer) (CSS). The server is not included in this package — see the [source repository](https://github.com/masterworrall/agent-interition) for Docker setup instructions.

Before using any commands, ensure:
1. A Community Solid Server is running and reachable (default: `http://localhost:3000`)
2. `SOLID_SERVER_URL` is set to your server's URL (default: `http://localhost:3000`). **Only point this at a server you control and trust** — the Skill will exchange credentials with it.
3. `INTERITION_PASSPHRASE` is set (used to encrypt stored credentials). Use a strong passphrase and keep it secret.

## How It Works

This Skill provides **three management scripts** for CSS-specific operations (provisioning, deprovisioning, status) plus a **token helper** for authentication. All standard Solid operations (read, write, delete, share) are done with **curl and a Bearer token** — your Pod is a standard W3C Solid server.

### Two-Step Workflow

**Step 1:** Get a token:
```bash
scripts/get-token.sh --agent <name>
```

Output:
```json
{"token": "eyJhbG...", "expiresIn": 600, "serverUrl": "http://localhost:3000", "podUrl": "http://localhost:3000/agents/researcher/", "webId": "http://localhost:3000/agents/researcher/profile/card#me"}
```

**Step 2:** Use curl with `Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN` for any Solid operation.

### Token Expiry

Tokens last **600 seconds** (10 minutes). If more than **8 minutes** have elapsed since your last `get-token.sh` call, fetch a new token before making requests.

## Quick Reference

Extract token and URLs:
```bash
TOKEN_JSON=$(scripts/get-token.sh --agent researcher)
TOKEN=$(echo "$TOKEN_JSON" | jq -r '.token')
POD_URL=$(echo "$TOKEN_JSON" | jq -r '.podUrl')
```

**Read a resource:**
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "${POD_URL}memory/notes.ttl"
```

**Write a resource:**
```bash
curl -s -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: text/turtle" \
  -d '@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/>.
<#note-1> a schema:Note;
  schema:text "Important finding";
  schema:dateCreated "2024-01-15".' \
  "${POD_URL}memory/notes.ttl"
```

**Delete a resource:**
```bash
curl -s -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "${POD_URL}memory/old.ttl"
```

## Management Commands

### Provision a New Agent

Creates a WebID and Pod for an agent. Run this once per agent.

```bash
scripts/provision.sh --name <agent-name> [--displayName <display-name>]
```

**Example:**
```bash
scripts/provision.sh --name researcher --displayName "Research Assistant"
```

**Output:**
```json
{"status": "ok", "agent": "researcher", "webId": "http://localhost:3000/agents/researcher/profile/card#me", "podUrl": "http://localhost:3000/agents/researcher/"}
```

### Deprovision an Agent

Fully removes an agent: deletes its pods, client credentials, WebID links, and password logins from the CSS server, then deletes local credential files.

```bash
scripts/deprovision.sh --name <agent-name>
```

**Example:**
```bash
scripts/deprovision.sh --name researcher
```

**Output (success):**
```json
{"status": "ok", "agent": "researcher", "accountDeleted": true, "credentialsDeleted": true}
```

**Output (partial — e.g. server unreachable):**
```json
{"status": "partial", "agent": "researcher", "accountDeleted": false, "credentialsDeleted": true, "warnings": ["Could not delete CSS account: ..."]}
```

- `status: "ok"` — CSS account fully dismantled and local files deleted
- `status: "partial"` — local files deleted but CSS cleanup failed (see warnings)

If the agent was provisioned before email/password storage was added, CSS cleanup is skipped and a warning explains why.

### Check Status

Lists all provisioned agents and their details.

```bash
scripts/status.sh
```

## Pod Structure

Each agent's Pod has these containers:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/agents/{name}/memory/` | Private agent memory (notes, learned facts, preferences) |
| `/agents/{name}/shared/` | Resources intended for sharing with other agents |
| `/agents/{name}/conversations/` | Conversation logs and context |

## Turtle Templates

When storing structured data, use Turtle (RDF) format. Here are templates for common patterns:

### A note or memory
```turtle
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/>.
<#note-1> a schema:Note;
  schema:text "The content of the note";
  schema:dateCreated "2024-01-15".
```

### An agent preference
```turtle
@prefix foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>.
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/>.
<#pref-1> a schema:PropertyValue;
  schema:name "response-style";
  schema:value "concise".
```

### A shared dataset
```turtle
@prefix schema: <http://schema.org/>.
<#dataset-1> a schema:Dataset;
  schema:name "Research Results";
  schema:description "Findings from the analysis task";
  schema:dateModified "2024-01-15".
```

## Error Handling

All management commands output JSON. On error, stderr will contain:
```json
{"error": "description of what went wrong"}
```

Common errors:
- `"No passphrase provided"` — Set `INTERITION_PASSPHRASE` env var
- `"No credentials found"` — Run `provision.sh` first
- `"Invalid passphrase"` — Wrong `INTERITION_PASSPHRASE` value
- `"Token request failed: 401"` — Credentials expired; re-provision the agent
- `"HTTP 404"` — Resource doesn't exist at that URL
