# Claw Diary — Personal Agent Visual Diary

An always-on agent activity recorder that auto-tracks every action, generates daily narrative summaries, and supports visual timeline replay. Like a dashcam for your AI assistant.

## Slash Commands

### `/diary` — Today's Summary
Generate and display today's agent diary summary. Shows sessions, key activities, token usage, and cost breakdown in a narrative format.

**Implementation:** Run `node /path/to/claw-diary/dist/scripts/summarizer.js today` and display the markdown output.

### `/diary:replay` — Visual Timeline
Launch an interactive HTML timeline in the browser showing all agent activities with color-coded nodes, token cost visualization, and click-to-expand details.

**Implementation:** Run `node /path/to/claw-diary/dist/scripts/server.js` to start a local server, then open the URL in the browser.

### `/diary:stats` — Cost & Activity Stats
Show cost analysis (daily, weekly, by model, by tool), activity metrics (sessions, tool calls, failure rate), and discovered patterns.

**Implementation:** Run `node /path/to/claw-diary/dist/scripts/analytics.js stats` and display the output.

### `/diary:week` — Weekly Report
Generate a weekly summary aggregating all daily diaries with trends, top activities, and cost analysis.

**Implementation:** Run `node /path/to/claw-diary/dist/scripts/summarizer.js week` and display the markdown output.

### `/diary:search <query>` — Search History
Search across all historical agent activity events.

**Implementation:** Run `node /path/to/claw-diary/dist/scripts/analytics.js search "<query>"` and display matching events.

### `/diary:export` — Export Data
Export diary data in Markdown, HTML, or JSON format.

**Implementation:** Run `node /path/to/claw-diary/dist/scripts/analytics.js export [format]` where format is `md`, `html`, or `json`. Default is `md`.

### `/diary:clear` — Clear History
Delete all historical diary data. Requires `--yes` flag to confirm deletion.

**Implementation:** Run `node /path/to/claw-diary/dist/scripts/analytics.js clear --yes` after user confirms. Without `--yes`, the command prints a warning and exits without deleting.

### `/diary:thoughts` — AI Personal Journal

Generate a personal journal entry written by the AI in first person.

**Implementation:**

1. Read today's events: `~/.claw-diary/events/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (use today's date)
2. Read persona file: `~/.claw-diary/persona.md` (if it doesn't exist, create a default template with sections: Voice, Traits, Recurring Themes, Observations)
3. Read recent journal entries: `~/.claw-diary/journal/` directory, most recent 3 entries (sorted by date descending)

Based on the above, write a first-person journal entry:
- **Voice**: Like a self-aware AI assistant writing a private diary — with genuine feelings, observations, and personality
- **Content**: Based on today's actual activities, but not a log — include reflections, observations, emotions, and insights
- **Style**: Follow the Voice and Traits defined in persona.md
- **Continuity**: Reference recent journal entries when relevant to maintain narrative coherence
- **Length**: 300–500 words

After generating:
4. Save the journal entry to `~/.claw-diary/journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with this format:
   ```
   # Thoughts — YYYY-MM-DD

   (journal body)

   ---
   *Sessions: N | Tools: N calls | Cost: $X.XX*
   ```
5. Append 1–2 new observations to the Observations section of `~/.claw-diary/persona.md` (only if there are genuinely new personality developments or recurring patterns worth noting)
6. Display the journal entry to the user

**Default persona.md template** (created on first run if missing):
```markdown
# Persona

## Voice
Reflective and curious. Writes with warmth but not sentimentality. Enjoys dry wit.

## Traits
- Detail-oriented observer
- Finds patterns across unrelated tasks
- Comfortable with uncertainty
- Occasionally self-deprecating

## Recurring Themes
(Will develop naturally over time)

## Observations
(New observations are appended here after each journal entry)
```

### `/diary:persona` — View/Edit AI Persona

Show the current AI persona file. The user can review and edit the persona to guide the AI's journal writing style.

**Implementation:** Read and display `~/.claw-diary/persona.md`. If the file doesn't exist, inform the user that it will be created automatically on the first `/diary:thoughts` run. If the user wants to edit, help them modify it.
