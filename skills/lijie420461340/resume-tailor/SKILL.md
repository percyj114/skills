## What Makes Resumes Get Noticed

### ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Optimization

Most large companies use ATS to filter resumes before humans see them.

**How ATS Works:**
1. Scans for keywords matching job description
2. Ranks candidates by keyword match percentage
3. Only top-ranked resumes reach human reviewers

**Optimization Tips:**
| Do | Don't |
|-----|-------|
| Use exact keywords from job posting | Use clever synonyms ATS won't recognize |
| Spell out acronyms AND include them | Assume ATS knows all abbreviations |
| Use standard section headers | Use creative headers like "My Journey" |
| Submit in PDF or DOCX | Submit in unusual formats |
| Use simple formatting | Use tables, columns, graphics |

### Power Verbs by Category

**Leadership:**
- Directed, Led, Managed, Orchestrated, Spearheaded
- Championed, Pioneered, Established, Launched

**Achievement:**
- Achieved, Delivered, Exceeded, Surpassed, Outperformed
- Increased, Reduced, Improved, Optimized, Streamlined

**Technical:**
- Developed, Engineered, Implemented, Architected, Designed
- Automated, Integrated, Migrated, Deployed, Scaled

**Communication:**
- Collaborated, Presented, Negotiated, Influenced, Advocated
- Authored, Documented, Trained, Mentored, Facilitated

### Quantification Formula

Transform weak bullets into strong ones:

**Weak:** "Responsible for sales"
**Strong:** "Generated $2.5M in new revenue by acquiring 45 enterprise accounts"

**Formula:** [Power Verb] + [What] + [Quantified Result] + [How/Context]

**Examples:**
- "Reduced deployment time by 75% (from 4 hours to 1 hour) by implementing CI/CD pipeline"
- "Managed cross-functional team of 12 engineers across 3 time zones to deliver product on time"
- "Increased customer retention by 23% through implementing proactive support program"

## Limitations

- I can't verify your experience - be truthful
- I don't know internal company culture - research separately
- ATS systems vary - no guarantee of getting through all
- I can't see your actual formatting - you'll need to apply changes
- For executive roles, consider professional resume services

## Languages

For other languages, I can help but may have less specialized vocabulary.
