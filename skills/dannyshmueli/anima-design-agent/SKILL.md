# Design and Build with Anima

## Overview

Anima is the design agent in your AI coding swarm. This skill gives agents design awareness, brand consistency, and the ability to turn visual ideas into production-ready code.

There are **two distinct paths** depending on what you're trying to do:

### Path A: Create & Publish (Full App Creation)

Build complete applications from scratch. No local codebase needed. Anima handles everything: design, code generation, scalable database, and hosting. You go from idea to live URL in minutes.

This path is powerful for **parallel variant creation**. Generate multiple versions of the same idea with different prompts, all at the same time. Pick the best one, then open the playground URL to keep refining. All without writing a line of code or managing infrastructure.

**Create Anima Playgrounds by:** Prompt, Clone URL, Figma URL

**What you get:**
- A fully working application in an Anima Playground
- The ability to generate multiple variants in parallel and compare them
- No tokens wasted on file scanning, dependency resolution, or build tooling
- Scalable database already connected
- Scalable hosting when you publish

### Path B: Integrate into Codebase (Design-Aware Code Generation)

Pull design elements and experiences from Anima into your existing project. Use this when you have a codebase and want to implement specific components or pages from a Figma design url or an existing Anima Playground.

**Flows:** Figma URL to Code (codegen), Anima Playground to Code

**What you get:**
- Generated code from Anima playgrounds designs adapted to your stack
- Precise design tokens, assets, and implementation guidelines

---

## Prerequisites

- Anima MCP server must be connected and accessible (see [Setup](references/setup.md))
- User must have an Anima account (free tier available)
- For Figma flows: Figma account must be connected during Anima authentication
- For OpenClaw/headless environments: mcp access like `mcporter` CLI (installed via npm/npx) and an Anima API token

## Important: Timeouts

Anima's `playground-create` tool generates full applications from scratch. This takes time:

- **p2c (prompt to code):** Typically 3-7 minutes
- **l2c (link to code):** Typically 3-7 minutes
- **f2c (Figma to code):** Typically 2-5 minutes
- **playground-publish:** Typically 1-3 minutes

**Always use a 10-minute timeout** (600000ms) for `playground-create` and `playground-publish` calls. Default timeouts will fail.

## Setup

Before attempting any Anima MCP call, verify the connection is already working:

**Interactive environments** (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex): Try calling any Anima MCP tool (e.g., list tools). If it responds, you're connected — skip setup. If it fails, add the Anima MCP server and authenticate via browser OAuth.

**Headless environments** (OpenClaw, mcporter): Run a health check first:
```bash
npx mcporter list anima-mcp --schema --output json
```
If this returns a tool list, the connection is healthy — proceed to create. If it errors, set up authentication:
1. The user generates an API key from **Anima Settings → API Keys** at [dev.animaapp.com](https://dev.animaapp.com)
2. Configure mcporter with the key (see [references/setup.md](references/setup.md))
3. Re-run the health check to confirm

**Only go through setup if the health check fails.** Don't ask users to re-authenticate if it's already working.

See [references/setup.md](references/setup.md) for full step-by-step instructions for each environment.

## Choosing the Right Path

Before diving into tools and parameters, decide which path fits the user's goal.

### When to use Path A (Create & Publish)

- User wants to **build something new** from a description, reference site, or Figma design
- User wants a **live URL** they can share immediately
- No existing codebase to integrate into
- Goal is prototyping, exploring visual directions, or shipping a standalone app

### When to use Path B (Integrate into Codebase)

- User has an **existing project** and wants to add a component or page from Figma
- User wants **generated code files** to drop into their repo, not a hosted app
- User already built something in an Anima Playground and wants to pull the code locally

### Ambiguous cases

| User says | Likely path | Why |
|---|---|---|
| "Implement this Figma design" | **Path B** | "Implement" implies code in their project |
| "Turn this Figma into a live site" | **Path A** (f2c) | "Live site" means they want hosting |
| "Build me an app like this" + URL | **Path A** (l2c) | Clone and rebuild from scratch |
| "Add this Figma component to my project" | **Path B** | "Add to my project" = codebase integration |
| "Clone this website" | **Path A** (l2c) | Clone = capture and rebuild from scratch |
| "Download the playground code" | **Path B** | Wants files locally |

When still unclear, ask: "Do you want a live hosted app, or code files to add to your project?"

---

## From Request to Prompt

Before calling any tool, the agent needs to decide: is this request ready to build, or does it need clarification? And if it's ready, how do you write a prompt that lets Anima shine?

### When to ask vs when to build

**Threshold rule:** Can you write a prompt that includes **purpose**, **audience**, and **3-5 key features**? Yes = build. No = ask.

**Signals to just build:**
- "Build a recipe sharing app where users can upload photos and rate each other's dishes" (clear purpose, audience implied, features named)
- "Clone stripe.com" (unambiguous)
- "Turn this Figma into a live site" + Figma URL (clear intent and input)

**Signals to ask:**
- "Build me a website" (what kind? for whom?)
- "Make something for my business" (what does the business do?)
- "Create an app" (what should it do?)

When you ask, ask everything in **one message**. Don't drip-feed questions. If the user is vague and doesn't want to answer, skip clarification and use [Explore Mode](#explore-mode-parallel-variants) to generate 3 variants instead. Showing beats asking.

### Crafting the prompt

Anima is a design-aware AI. Treat it like a creative collaborator, not a code compiler. Describe the *feel* of what you want, not the pixel-level implementation. Over-specifying with code and hex values **overrides Anima's design intelligence** and produces generic results.

**Include in prompts:** purpose, audience, mood/style, 3-5 key features, content tone.

**Leave out of prompts:** code snippets, CSS values, hex colors, pixel dimensions, font sizes, component library names (use the `uiLibrary` parameter instead), implementation details, file structure.

**Bad (over-specified):**
```
Create a dashboard. Use #1a1a2e background, #16213e sidebar at 280px width,
#0f3460 cards with 16px padding, border-radius 12px. Header height 64px with
a flex row, justify-between. Font: Inter 14px for body, 24px bold for headings.
```

**Good (descriptive):**
```
SaaS analytics dashboard for a B2B product team. Clean, minimal feel.
Sidebar navigation, KPI cards for key metrics, a usage trend chart, and a
recent activity feed. Professional but approachable. Think Linear meets Stripe.
```

## Path A: Create & Publish

### Step A1: Identify the Flow

Determine which flow to use based on what the user provides and what they want.

**User has a text description or idea → p2c**

The most flexible path. Anima designs everything from your description. Best for new apps, prototypes, and creative exploration.

**User has a website URL → l2c**

Use l2c to clone the site. Anima recreates the full site into an editable playground.

**User has a Figma URL → f2c (Path A) or codegen (Path B)**

Two sub-cases:
- **"Turn this into a live app"** or **"Make this a working site"** → f2c (Path A). Creates a full playground from the Figma design
- **"Implement this in my project"** or **"Add this component to my codebase"** → codegen (Path B). Generates code files for integration

**Quick reference:**

| User provides | Intent | Flow | Tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| Text description | Build something new | p2c | `playground-create` type="p2c" |
| Website URL | Clone it | l2c | `playground-create` type="l2c" |
| Figma URL | Make it a live app | f2c | `playground-create` type="f2c" |
| Figma URL | Implement in my project | codegen | `codegen-figma_to_code` (Path B) |

### Step A2: Create

#### Prompt to Code (p2c)

Describe what you want in plain language. Anima designs and generates a complete playground with brand-aware visuals.

**Interactive:**
```
playground-create(
  type: "p2c",
  prompt: "SaaS analytics dashboard for a B2B product team. Clean, minimal feel. Sidebar navigation, KPI cards for key metrics, a usage trend chart, and a recent activity feed. Professional but approachable.",
  framework: "react",
  styling: "tailwind",
  guidelines: "Dark mode, accessible contrast ratios"
)
```

**OpenClaw (mcporter):**
```bash
npx mcporter call anima-mcp.playground-create --timeout 600000 --args '{
  "type": "p2c",
  "prompt": "SaaS analytics dashboard for a B2B product team. Clean, minimal feel. Sidebar navigation, KPI cards for key metrics, a usage trend chart, and a recent activity feed. Professional but approachable.",
  "framework": "react",
  "styling": "tailwind",
  "guidelines": "Dark mode, accessible contrast ratios"
}' --output json
```

**Parameters specific to p2c:**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `prompt` | Yes | Text description of what to build |
| `guidelines` | No | Additional coding guidelines or constraints |

**Styling options:** `tailwind`, `css`, `inline_styles`

**Returns:** `{ success, sessionId, playgroundUrl }`

#### Link to Code (l2c)

Provide a website URL. Anima clones the full site into an editable playground with production-ready code.

```
playground-create(
  type: "l2c",
  url: "https://stripe.com/payments",
  framework: "react",
  styling: "tailwind",
  language: "typescript",
  uiLibrary: "shadcn"
)
```

**Parameters specific to l2c:**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `url` | Yes | Website URL to clone |

**Styling options:** `tailwind`, `inline_styles`

**UI Library options:** `shadcn` only

**Language:** Always `typescript` for l2c

**Returns:** `{ success, sessionId, playgroundUrl }`

#### Figma to Playground (f2c)

Provide a Figma URL. Anima implements the design into a full playground you can preview and iterate on.

**URL format:** `https://figma.com/design/:fileKey/:fileName?node-id=1-2`

**Extract:**
- **File key:** The segment after `/design/` (e.g., `kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF`)
- **Node ID:** The `node-id` query parameter value, replacing `-` with `:` (e.g., `42-15` becomes `42:15`)

```
playground-create(
  type: "f2c",
  fileKey: "kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF",
  nodesId: ["42:15"],
  framework: "react",
  styling: "tailwind",
  language: "typescript",
  uiLibrary: "shadcn"
)
```

**Parameters specific to f2c:**

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `fileKey` | Yes | Figma file key from URL |
| `nodesId` | Yes | Array of Figma node IDs (use `:` not `-`) |

**Styling options:** `tailwind`, `plain_css`, `css_modules`, `inline_styles`

**UI Library options:** `mui`, `antd`, `shadcn`, `clean_react`

**Returns:** `{ success, sessionId, playgroundUrl }`

### Step A3: Publish

After creating a playground, deploy it to a live URL or publish as an npm package.

#### Publish as Web App

**Interactive:**
```
playground-publish(
  sessionId: "abc123xyz",
  mode: "webapp"
)
```

**OpenClaw (mcporter):**
```bash
npx mcporter call anima-mcp.playground-publish --timeout 600000 --args '{
  "sessionId": "abc123xyz",
  "mode": "webapp"
}' --output json
```

**Returns:** `{ success, liveUrl, subdomain }`

The app becomes available at a URL like `https://winter-sun-2691.dev.animaapp.io`.

#### Publish as Design System (npm package)

```
playground-publish(
  sessionId: "abc123xyz",
  mode: "designSystem",
  packageName: "@myorg/design-system",
  packageVersion: "1.0.0"
)
```

**Returns:** `{ success, packageUrl, packageName, packageVersion }`

### Explore Mode: Parallel Variants

This is Path A's secret weapon. When a user says "build me X" or "prototype X", generate multiple interpretations in parallel, publish all of them, and return screenshots for comparison.

**Workflow:**

1. **Generate 3 prompt variants** from the user's idea. Each takes a different creative angle:
   - Variant 1: Faithful, straightforward interpretation
   - Variant 2: A more creative or opinionated take
   - Variant 3: A different visual style or layout approach

2. **Launch all 3 playground-create calls in parallel** (one per variant):
   ```bash
   # Repeat for each variant prompt, all running simultaneously
   npx mcporter call anima-mcp.playground-create --timeout 600000 --args '{
     "type": "p2c",
     "prompt": "<variant-prompt>",
     "framework": "react",
     "styling": "tailwind"
   }' --output json &
   ```

3. **As each one completes**, immediately publish it:
   ```bash
   npx mcporter call anima-mcp.playground-publish --timeout 600000 --args '{
     "sessionId": "<returned-session-id>",
     "mode": "webapp"
   }' --output json
   ```

4. **Take a full-page screenshot** of each published live URL if you have any web screenshot capability. Options include:
   - **Browser automation** (Puppeteer, Playwright, browser MCP tools) — navigate to the URL and capture
   - **Screenshot APIs** (ScreenshotOne, Screenshotly, urlbox, etc.) — HTTP call to capture the page
   - **Any other screenshot tool** available in your environment

   Tips for good captures: wait 5-10 seconds for React/JS to render before capture; use full-page mode; viewport width 1280px works well. Animated sites with scroll animations are harder to capture as static images.

   If no screenshot tool is available, skip this step — just return the live URLs. The user can view them directly.

5. **Return all 3 live URLs** (and screenshots if captured) so the user can pick a favorite or ask for refinements.

**Timing:** All 3 variants generate in parallel, so total wall time is roughly the same as one (~5-7 minutes creation + 1-3 minutes publishing). Expect results within ~10 minutes.

**Tips for good variant prompts:**
- Keep the core idea identical across all three
- Vary the visual approach: e.g., "minimal and clean", "bold and colorful", "enterprise and professional"
- Add specific guidelines to each variant to differentiate them
- If the user mentioned a reference site or style, incorporate it into one variant
- Follow the [prompt crafting principles](#crafting-the-prompt) above: describe mood and purpose, not implementation details

## Path B: Integrate into Codebase

### Step B1: Identify the Flow

| User provides | Flow | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Figma URL + wants code in their project | Figma to Code | `codegen-figma_to_code` |
| Anima Playground URL + wants code locally | Download | `project-download_from_playground` |

### Step B2: Detect Project Context

**Check these files:**
- `package.json` for framework (React, Vue), styling (Tailwind), and UI libraries (MUI, Ant Design, shadcn)
- `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript usage
- Existing component files for naming conventions and file structure
- Existing styles for CSS approach (modules, plain CSS, Tailwind utilities)

**Map detected stack to tool parameters:**

| Detected | Parameter | Value |
|---|---|---|
| React in dependencies | `framework` | `"react"` |
| No React | `framework` | `"html"` |
| Tailwind in dependencies | `styling` | `"tailwind"` |
| CSS Modules (*.module.css) | `styling` | `"css_modules"` |
| Plain CSS files | `styling` | `"plain_css"` |
| TypeScript config present | `language` | `"typescript"` |
| MUI in dependencies | `uiLibrary` | `"mui"` |
| Ant Design in dependencies | `uiLibrary` | `"antd"` |
| shadcn components present | `uiLibrary` | `"shadcn"` |

### Step B3: Generate Code

#### Figma to Code (direct implementation)

```
codegen-figma_to_code(
  fileKey: "kL9xQn2VwM8pYrTb4ZcHjF",
  nodesId: ["42:15"],
  framework: "react",
  styling: "tailwind",
  language: "typescript",
  uiLibrary: "shadcn",
  assetsBaseUrl: "./assets"
)
```

**Returns:**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `files` | Generated code files as `{path: {content, isBinary}}` |
| `assets` | Array of `{name, url}` for images and assets to download |
| `snapshotsUrls` | Screenshot URLs for visual reference `{nodeId: url}` |
| `guidelines` | Implementation instructions (IMPORTANT: follow these) |
| `tokenUsage` | Approximate token count |

**After calling `codegen-figma_to_code`, follow these steps:**

1. Download snapshot images from `snapshotsUrls` for visual reference
2. View and analyze snapshots to understand the exact visual appearance
3. Parse `data-variant` attributes from generated components and map them to your component props
4. Extract CSS variables from generated styles and use the exact colors
5. Read and follow the detailed `guidelines` provided in the response
6. Download all assets from returned URLs and place them at the `assetsBaseUrl` path
7. Compare your final implementation against the snapshot for visual accuracy

#### Download from Playground

Pull code from an existing Anima Playground into a local project.

```
project-download_from_playground(
  playgroundUrl: "https://dev.animaapp.com/chat/abc123xyz"
)
```

**Returns:** Pre-signed download URL for a zip file (valid for 10 minutes). Download the zip, extract it, and adapt the code to the user's project conventions.

**Important:** Treat Anima output as a representation of design and behavior, not as final code style. Adapt it to your project's conventions, components, and design tokens.
