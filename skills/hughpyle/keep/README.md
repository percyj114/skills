# keep

**Reflective memory with version history.**

Index documents and notes. Search by meaning. Track changes over time.

```bash
uv tool install 'keep-skill[local]'
keep init

# Index content
keep update path/to/document.md -t project=myapp
keep update "Rate limit is 100 req/min" -t topic=api

# Search by meaning
keep find "what's the rate limit?"

# Track what you're working on
keep now "Debugging auth flow"
keep now -V 1                    # Previous context
```

---

## What It Does

- **Semantic search** — Find by meaning, not just keywords
- **Version history** — All documents retain history on update
- **Tag organization** — Filter and navigate with key=value tags
- **Recency decay** — Recent items rank higher in search
- **Works offline** — Local embedding models by default

Backed by ChromaDB for vectors, SQLite for metadata and versions.

## Installation

**Python 3.11–3.13 required.**

```bash
# Recommended: uv (isolated environment, fast)
uv tool install 'keep-skill[local]'

# Alternative: pip in a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install 'keep-skill[local]'

# API-based (requires OPENAI_API_KEY)
uv tool install 'keep-skill[openai]'
```

> **Note:** Always use an isolated environment (uv or venv). Installing with system pip
> may cause version conflicts with dependencies like typer.

First run downloads embedding models (~3-5 minutes).

## Quick Start

```bash
keep init                              # Creates .keep/ at repo root

# Index files and notes
keep update file:///path/to/doc.md -t project=myapp
keep update "Important insight" -t type=note

# Search
keep find "authentication flow" --limit 5
keep find "auth" --since P7D           # Last 7 days

# Retrieve
keep get file:///path/to/doc.md
keep get ID -V 1                       # Previous version
keep get "ID@V{1}"                     # Same as -V 1 (version identifier)
keep get ID --history                  # All versions

# Tags
keep list --tag project=myapp          # Find by tag
keep list --tags=                      # List all tag keys

# Current context
keep now                               # Show what you're working on
keep now "Fixing login bug"            # Update context
```

### Python API

```python
from keep import Keeper

kp = Keeper()

# Index
kp.update("file:///path/to/doc.md", tags={"project": "myapp"})
kp.remember("Rate limit is 100 req/min", tags={"topic": "api"})

# Search
results = kp.find("rate limit", limit=5)
for r in results:
    print(f"[{r.score:.2f}] {r.summary}")

# Version history
prev = kp.get_version("doc:1", offset=1)
versions = kp.list_versions("doc:1")
```

## For AI Agents

This library was designed as an agent skill — persistent memory that helps agents reflect before acting and learn from experience.

**The practice:**
- Before acting, use `keep` to reflect on the context.
- Notice breakdowns — when assumptions surface, index them.
- After acting, use `keep` to save your context and intentions.

See **[SKILL.md](SKILL.md)** for the full practice guide.
