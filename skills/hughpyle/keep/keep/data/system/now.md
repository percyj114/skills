# Now

Now: reflect on this work using `keep`.

**Before acting:**
- Where are we in the conversation?
- What do I know? `keep now`
- What else is skillful? `keep find ...`

**After acting:**
- What happened? `keep update "what I learned" -t context=learning`
- What do I save? `keep update`
- What now? `keep now "Current intention: ..."`
