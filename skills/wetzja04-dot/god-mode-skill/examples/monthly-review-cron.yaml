    It's the 1st of the month - time for a monthly review!
    
    Run: god review
    
    Then analyze and tell me:
    
    1. **Activity Summary**: Which projects got the most attention last month?
    2. **Patterns**: Did I focus on one project or spread across many?
    3. **PR Velocity**: How many PRs were merged vs stalled?
    4. **Quiet Projects**: Any repos that went silent mid-month?
    5. **Accomplishments**: Based on commit messages, what did I ship?
    6. **Recommendations**: What should I focus on this month?
    
    Be conversational and insightful - this is my monthly retrospective.
