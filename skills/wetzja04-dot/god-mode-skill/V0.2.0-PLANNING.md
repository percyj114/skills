# god-mode v0.2.0 Planning

**Created:** 2026-02-02  
**Review Date:** 2026-02-05 or later  
**Status:** Planning phase

## Current Status (v0.1.0)

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Published to ClawHub: https://www.clawhub.ai/InfantLab/god-mode
- ✅ **84 downloads/installs** (as of 2026-02-02)
- ✅ All 47 tests passing
- ✅ Complete documentation (README, SKILL.md, examples)

### Open Questions

1. **Why not on clawdtm.com yet?**
   - Is there a review process?
   - Do we need to submit elsewhere?
   - Is it a caching/indexing delay?
   - Action: Check ClawHub submission status

2. **What's working? What's not?**
   - Have any of the 84 users given feedback?
   - Are there GitHub issues filed?
   - Usage analytics available?
   - Action: Check GitHub issues, ClawHub reviews

3. **What could be better?**
   - Description/positioning
   - Feature gaps
   - Documentation clarity
   - Installation experience

## Ideas for v0.2.0

### Potential Features (To Discuss)

**Developer Experience:**
- [ ] Interactive setup wizard (vs manual config.yaml)
- [ ] Better error messages when tools missing
- [ ] Auto-detect more project types (Rust, Go, Ruby, PHP?)
- [ ] Template/preset configs for common stacks

**Workflow Improvements:**
- [ ] `god-mode watch` - continuous status monitoring
- [ ] `god-mode triage` - prioritize which projects need attention
- [ ] Integration with Obsidian daily notes (auto-populate project status)
- [ ] Slack/Discord notifications for failed builds

**AI Agent Coaching:**
- [ ] More agent.md templates (frontend, backend, devops, ML)
- [ ] agent.md linter/validator
- [ ] Suggested improvements based on project activity

**Multi-Platform:**
- [ ] Better Azure DevOps support (currently basic)
- [ ] GitLab CI integration
- [ ] Bitbucket support?
- [ ] Self-hosted git (Gitea, Gogs)

**Quality of Life:**
- [ ] `god-mode dashboard` - terminal UI (blessed/ink?)
- [ ] Export to Markdown table for reports
- [ ] Time-since-last-commit warnings
- [ ] Stale branch detection

### Making It More Compelling

**Current Description (from ClawHub):**
> "Multi-project oversight and AI agent coaching for developers"

**Why might this not be compelling enough?**
- Too vague? (What does "oversight" mean?)
- Missing the pain point? (What problem does it solve?)
- Not showing the value? (Save time? Reduce context switching?)

**Alternative Positioning Ideas:**

**Option 1: Pain-Point Focused**
> "Stop losing track of your projects. god-mode shows you what needs attention across 15+ repos in seconds."

**Option 2: Workflow Hero**
> "Context switching killer. One command to see status, health, and next actions across all your active projects."

**Option 3: AI Agent Angle**
> "Coach your AI coding agents with project-aware context. god-mode generates agent.md files with repo state, conventions, and focus areas."

**Option 4: Dev Manager Angle**
> "God's-eye view of your development portfolio. Know what's building, what's broken, and what needs your attention."

**Option 5: Time-Saver**
> "Save 30 minutes/day checking project statuses. god-mode aggregates GitHub, Azure DevOps, and local git state into one view."

### Questions to Answer (Review Session)

1. **Target audience clarity**
   - Who is this REALLY for?
   - Solo devs with 5-20 projects?
   - Small teams (2-5 people)?
   - Consultants juggling client work?
   - Open source maintainers?

2. **Core value proposition**
   - What's the #1 problem it solves?
   - What's the "aha!" moment for new users?
   - What would make someone KEEP using it?

3. **Comparison to alternatives**
   - What else do people use for this?
   - How is god-mode different/better?
   - Why would someone choose this over writing their own scripts?

4. **Feature priorities**
   - Which of the ideas above have most impact?
   - What's the 80/20 here?
   - What can we ship quickly vs long-term?

5. **Distribution strategy**
   - ClawHub only?
   - Also npm package?
   - Standalone binary (Go rewrite)?
   - VS Code extension?

## Pre-Review Homework

**Before next planning session:**

- [ ] Check ClawHub analytics (if available)
- [ ] Review any GitHub issues filed against god-mode-skill
- [ ] Look at download/install stats breakdown
- [ ] Check if there's a clawdtm.com submission process
- [ ] Survey 3-5 potential users (what would make this indispensable?)
- [ ] Benchmark against similar tools (GitHub CLI, LazyGit, etc.)

## Metrics to Track for v0.2.0 Success

- [ ] Downloads: Target 200+ (vs current 84)
- [ ] GitHub stars: Target 20+ (vs current ?)
- [ ] Active users (return visitors): Target 20+ weekly
- [ ] Featured on ClawHub homepage or newsletter?
- [ ] At least 5 positive reviews/testimonials

## Timeline (Tentative)

- **2026-02-05+:** Review session - finalize v0.2.0 scope
- **2026-02-15:** Feature development sprint
- **2026-02-28:** Testing + documentation
- **2026-03-01:** v0.2.0 release

**Next Steps:**
1. Schedule review session (few days from now)
2. Do homework above
3. Come back with data and user feedback
4. Decide what goes into v0.2.0
5. Rewrite description to be more compelling

**Notes:**
- 84 users is a good start! Shows people are interested
- Main goal: Turn those 84 into active, enthusiastic users
- Secondary goal: Get to 200+ downloads with v0.2.0
- Focus: Make the value proposition crystal clear
