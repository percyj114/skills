  Passive journaling skill that scans daily conversations via cron to generate
  markdown journals using semantic understanding.

  Use when:
  - User requests journaling ("Show me my journal", "What did I do today?")
  - User asks for pattern analysis ("Analyze my patterns", "How am I doing?")
  - User requests summaries ("Generate weekly/monthly summary")

# PhoenixClaw: Zero-Tag Passive Journaling

PhoenixClaw automatically distills daily conversations into meaningful reflections using semantic intelligence.

Automatically identifies journal-worthy moments, patterns, and growth opportunities.

## 🛠️ Core Workflow

> [!critical] **MANDATORY: Complete Workflow Execution**
> This 9-step workflow MUST be executed in full regardless of invocation method:
> - **Cron execution** (10 PM nightly)
> - **Manual invocation** ("Show me my journal", "Generate today's journal", etc.)
> - **Regeneration requests** ("Regenerate my journal", "Update today's entry")
> 
> **Never skip steps.** Partial execution causes:
> - Missing images (session logs not scanned)
> - Missing finance data (Ledger plugin not triggered)
> - Incomplete journals (plugins not executed)

PhoenixClaw follows a structured pipeline to ensure consistency and depth:

1. **User Configuration:** Check for `~/.phoenixclaw/config.yaml`. If missing, initiate the onboarding flow defined in `references/user-config.md`.

2. **Context Retrieval:** 
   - Call `memory_get` for the current day's memory
   - **CRITICAL: Scan ALL raw session logs** for the current day — session files are often split across multiple files. Use `ls -la` to list files and read **all files modified today**. Common paths (implementation-dependent): `~/.openclaw/sessions/*.jsonl` or `.agent/sessions/`
   - **Why session logs are mandatory**: `memory_get` returns **text only**. Image metadata, photo references, and media attachments are **only available in session logs**. Skipping session logs = missing all photos.
   - If memory is sparse, reconstruct context from session logs, then update memory
   - Incorporate historical context via `memory_search` (skip if embeddings unavailable)

3. **Moment Identification:** Identify "journal-worthy" content: critical decisions, emotional shifts, milestones, or shared media. See `references/media-handling.md` for photo processing. This step generates the `moments` data structure that plugins depend on.

4. **Pattern Recognition:** Detect recurring themes, mood fluctuations, and energy levels. Map these to growth opportunities using `references/skill-recommendations.md`.

5. **Plugin Execution:** Execute all registered plugins at their declared hook points. See `references/plugin-protocol.md` for the complete plugin lifecycle:
   - `pre-analysis` → before conversation analysis
   - `post-moment-analysis` → **Ledger and other primary plugins execute here**
   - `post-pattern-analysis` → after patterns detected
   - `journal-generation` → plugins inject custom sections
   - `post-journal` → after journal complete

6. **Journal Generation:** Synthesize the day's events into a beautiful Markdown file using `assets/daily-template.md`. Follow the visual guidelines in `references/visual-design.md`. **Include all plugin-generated sections** at their declared `section_order` positions.

7. **Timeline Integration:** If significant events occurred, append them to the master index in `timeline.md` using the format from `assets/timeline-template.md` and `references/obsidian-format.md`.

8. **Growth Mapping:** Update `growth-map.md` (based on `assets/growth-map-template.md`) if new behavioral patterns or skill interests are detected.

9. **Profile Evolution:** Update the long-term user profile (`profile.md`) to reflect the latest observations on values, goals, and personality traits. See `references/profile-evolution.md` and `assets/profile-template.md`.

## ⏰ Cron & Passive Operation
PhoenixClaw is designed to run without user intervention. It utilizes OpenClaw's built-in cron system to trigger its analysis daily at 10:00 PM local time (0 22 * * *).
- Setup details can be found in `references/cron-setup.md`.
- **Mode:** Primarily Passive. The AI proactively summarizes the day's activities without being asked.

## 💬 Explicit Triggers

While passive by design, users can interact with PhoenixClaw directly using these phrases:
- *"Show me my journal for today/yesterday."*
- *"What did I accomplish today?"*
- *"Analyze my mood patterns over the last week."*
- *"Generate my weekly/monthly summary."*
- *"How am I doing on my personal goals?"*
- *"Regenerate my journal."* / *"重新生成日记"*

> [!warning] **Manual Invocation = Full Pipeline**
> When users request journal generation/regeneration, you MUST execute the **complete 9-step Core Workflow** above. This ensures:
> - **Photos are included** (via session log scanning)
> - **Ledger plugin runs** (via `post-moment-analysis` hook)
> - **All plugins execute** (at their respective hook points)
> 
> **Common mistakes to avoid:**
> - ❌ Only calling `memory_get` (misses photos)
> - ❌ Skipping moment identification (plugins never trigger)
> - ❌ Generating journal directly without plugin sections
