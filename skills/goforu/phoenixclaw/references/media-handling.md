| **CLI** | Local Path | User provides file path via command line |

> [!important] Media & Memory Tools
> Note: `memory_get` and `memory_search` return text only. Image metadata and binary references must be sourced from session logs (JSONL) or the local `assets` directory. Scan session logs even when daily memory exists to capture in-progress media.

### Photo Processing Workflow

1. **Receive**: Capture media from the active channel (Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord/CLI).
2. **Buffer**: Store the raw media in a transient memory buffer with metadata (timestamp, source).
3. **Detect**: Cron job or trigger detects unresolved media references in the message stream.
4. **Vision Analysis**: AI processes the photo to extract a descriptive alt-text (e.g., "Spicy miso ramen with soft-boiled egg").
5. **Relocate**: Move file from transient buffer to the permanent assets directory.
6. **Rename**: Apply standard naming convention to the file.
7. **Embed**: Generate the Obsidian-style markdown link and insert into the journal with the appropriate layout.

### Storage & Naming

**Path**: `~/PhoenixClaw/Journal/assets/YYYY-MM-DD/`

**File Naming**:
- Primary format: `img_XXX.jpg` (zero-padded)
- Example: `img_001.jpg`, `img_002.jpg`
- For specific events: `img_001_lunch.jpg` (optional suffix)

### Journal Photo Layouts

#### Single Photo (Moment)
Used for capturing a specific point in time or a single highlight.
```markdown
> [!moment] 🍜 12:30 Lunch
> ![[assets/2026-02-01/img_001.jpg|400]]
> Spicy miso ramen with a perfectly soft-boiled egg at the new shop downtown.
```

#### Multiple Photos (Gallery)
Used when several photos are sent together or relate to the same context.
```markdown
> [!gallery] 📷 Today's Moments
> ![[assets/2026-02-01/img_002.jpg|200]] ![[assets/2026-02-01/img_003.jpg|200]]
> ![[assets/2026-02-01/img_004.jpg|200]]
```

#### Photo with Narrative Context
Used when the photo is part of a larger story or reflection.
```markdown
### Weekend Hike
The trail was steeper than I remembered, but the view from the summit made every step worth it. 

![[assets/2026-02-01/img_005.jpg|600]]
*The fog rolling over the valley at 8:00 AM.*

I spent about twenty minutes just sitting there, listening to the wind and watching the light change across the ridgeline.
```

### Metadata Handling
- **Exif Data**: Preserve original Exif data (GPS, Timestamp) where possible to assist in auto-locating "Moments".
- **Captions**: If a user sends a caption with the photo, prioritize it as the primary description.
- **Deduplication**: Check file hashes before copying to prevent duplicate assets for the same entry.
