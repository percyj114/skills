  "description": "CLAW Observability instruments your Claude Code sessions with a live visual dashboard. Using Claude Code hooks, it automatically reports every agent lifecycle event — task starts, completions, errors, and parallel activations — to an interactive organogram, timeline, and analytics view. No curl commands, no agent instructions, no manual reporting. Just install, set two env vars, and get full operational visibility into your multi-agent workflows.",
