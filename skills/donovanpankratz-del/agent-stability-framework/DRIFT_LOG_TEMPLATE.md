# Drift Log

Track personality drift incidents here. Patterns become new standing orders.

| Date | What Drifted | Category | Correction |
|------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 2026-02-20 | Added "I hope this helps" to end of response | scope | Standing order: no closing pleasantries |
| | | | |

**Categories:** tone, scope, confidence, length, unsolicited

## How to Use

When you catch drift (agent sounds generic, adds unnecessary content, hedges more):
1. Log it here with the date and what happened
2. Identify the category
3. Note what correction was applied
4. If this pattern repeats 2+ times, add a new standing order to prevent it permanently
