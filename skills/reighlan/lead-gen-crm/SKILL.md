# Lead Gen + CRM Pipeline

Full lead generation pipeline — from discovery to CRM to outreach. Find prospects, enrich their data, qualify them, push to your CRM, and automate follow-up sequences.

## Setup

### Dependencies

```bash
pip3 install requests
```

### API Keys (configure in `config.json`)

- **Brave Search API** — lead discovery (already configured if web_search works)
- **Hunter.io** — email finding/verification (`HUNTER_API_KEY`, free 25 searches/mo)
- **HubSpot** — CRM integration (`HUBSPOT_API_KEY`)
- **Pipedrive** — CRM integration (`PIPEDRIVE_API_KEY` + `PIPEDRIVE_DOMAIN`)
- **Zoho** — CRM integration (`ZOHO_ACCESS_TOKEN`)
- **SendGrid or SMTP** — outreach emails (`SENDGRID_API_KEY` or SMTP config)

Not all are required — use what fits your stack.

### Workspace

```
lead-gen/
├── config.json           # API keys, CRM selection, scoring rules
├── leads/                # Lead database (JSON files)
│   ├── raw/              # Newly discovered leads
│   ├── enriched/         # Leads with contact data

```

Run `scripts/init-workspace.sh` to create this structure.

## Core Workflows

### 1. Lead Discovery

Find leads matching your ideal customer profile:

```bash
scripts/discover-leads.sh --query "ai agency owner" --count 20
scripts/discover-leads.sh --query "shopify store owner" --industry ecommerce --location "United States"
scripts/discover-leads.sh --directory yelp --category "marketing agencies" --location "Los Angeles"
```

Discovery sources:
- **Brave Search** — find companies/people matching criteria
- **Web scraping** — extract contact info from search results
- **Directory parsing** — structured business directories

Output: raw lead JSON files in `leads/raw/`.

### 2. Lead Enrichment

Add contact data and company info to raw leads:

```bash
scripts/enrich-lead.sh <lead-id>
scripts/enrich-leads.sh --batch raw    # Enrich all raw leads
```

Enrichment adds:
- **Email addresses** — via Hunter.io or pattern matching
- **Company info** — website, size, industry, tech stack
- **Social profiles** — LinkedIn, Twitter handles
- **Domain authority** — basic SEO metrics

### 3. Lead Scoring

Score leads based on configurable criteria:

```bash
scripts/score-leads.sh                  # Score all enriched leads
scripts/score-leads.sh --threshold 70   # Only qualify leads scoring 70+
```

Default scoring rubric (customizable in `config.json`):
- **Company size fit** (0-25) — matches your target
- **Industry match** (0-25) — in your target verticals
- **Email available** (0-20) — can reach them
- **Web presence** (0-15) — active website, social profiles
- **Tech signals** (0-15) — uses relevant technology

Leads scoring above threshold move to `leads/qualified/`.

### 4. CRM Integration

Push qualified leads to your CRM:

```bash
scripts/push-to-crm.sh <lead-id>
scripts/push-to-crm.sh --batch qualified   # Push all qualified leads
scripts/push-to-crm.sh --crm hubspot       # Override default CRM
```

Supported CRMs:
- **HubSpot** — creates contact + deal, sets pipeline stage
- **Pipedrive** — creates person + deal
- **Zoho** — creates lead record
- **CSV export** — fallback for any CRM via import

See `references/crm-setup.md` for per-CRM configuration.

### 5. Email Outreach

Run automated outreach campaigns with follow-ups:

```bash
scripts/create-campaign.sh --name "q1-outreach" --template cold-intro --leads qualified
scripts/send-campaign.sh --campaign "q1-outreach" --dry-run    # Preview first
scripts/send-campaign.sh --campaign "q1-outreach"              # Send for real
```

Campaign features:
- **Templates with variables** — personalized per lead
- **Multi-step sequences** — initial + 2-3 follow-ups
- **Delay between steps** — configurable (default 3 days)
- **Tracking** — opens, replies, bounces (via SendGrid)
- **Auto-pause** — stops sequence when lead replies
- **Human approval** — requires explicit approval before sending

**Critical: Never send without user approval.** `--dry-run` always first.

### 6. Pipeline Reports

```bash
scripts/pipeline-report.sh                 # Current pipeline summary
scripts/pipeline-report.sh --weekly        # Weekly activity report
scripts/pipeline-report.sh --conversion    # Conversion funnel metrics
```

## Email Templates

Store in `templates/` as JSON:

```json
{
  "name": "cold-intro",
  "subject": "Quick question about {company_name}",
  "body": "Hi {first_name},\n\nI noticed {company_name} is {personalization_hook}.\n\nWe help companies like yours {value_prop}.\n\nWould you be open to a quick chat this week?\n\nBest,\n{sender_name}",
  "follow_ups": [
    {
      "delay_days": 3,
      "subject": "Re: Quick question about {company_name}",
      "body": "Hi {first_name},\n\nJust following up on my previous note. {follow_up_hook}\n\nHappy to share more details if helpful.\n\nBest,\n{sender_name}"
    },
    {
      "delay_days": 7,
      "subject": "Last note from me",
      "body": "Hi {first_name},\n\nDon't want to be a pest — just one last check. If {value_prop_short} isn't a priority right now, no worries at all.\n\nIf timing changes, I'm here.\n\nBest,\n{sender_name}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Safety & Compliance

- **CAN-SPAM / GDPR** — always include unsubscribe option
- **Rate limiting** — max 50 emails/day by default (configurable)
- **Bounce handling** — auto-remove bounced addresses
- **Never scrape emails from personal pages** — only business contacts
- **Always dry-run first** — no outreach without human review

## Cron Integration

- **Daily discovery** — run lead searches on schedule
- **Batch enrichment** — enrich new raw leads nightly
- **Follow-up sends** — check and send due follow-ups
- **Weekly pipeline report** — summarize funnel health
