# Email Outreach Best Practices

## Deliverability

### Domain Setup
- Use a separate domain for outreach (not your main domain)
- Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
- Warm up new domains: start with 10-20 emails/day, increase over 2-4 weeks

### Content Rules
- Avoid spam trigger words: "free", "guaranteed", "act now", "limited time"
- Keep HTML simple or use plain text
- Include a real physical address (CAN-SPAM requirement)
- Always include an unsubscribe mechanism

### Sending Patterns
- Max 50 emails/day per domain (for cold outreach)
- Space emails 30-60 seconds apart
- Don't send all at once — spread across the day
- Avoid weekends and holidays

## Compliance

### CAN-SPAM (US)
- Identify the message as an ad
- Include physical postal address
- Provide opt-out mechanism
- Honor opt-outs within 10 business days

### GDPR (EU)
- Must have legitimate interest basis
- Include clear opt-out
- Respond to data deletion requests
- Keep records of consent/basis

### Best Practice
- Only email business addresses (not personal)
- Keep first email short (<150 words)
- Personalize meaningfully (not just {first_name})
- Stop after 3 touches if no response
- Immediately remove anyone who asks

## Template Tips

### Subject Lines
- Keep under 50 characters
- Personalize with company name
- Avoid ALL CAPS and excessive punctuation
- Test multiple variations

### Body
- First line: why you're reaching out (personalized)
- Value proposition in 1-2 sentences
- Clear, simple CTA (not "buy now" — "quick chat?")
- Signature with real name and title

### Follow-ups
- Wait 3 days after initial email
- Reference the previous email
- Add new value (case study, insight)
- 3rd follow-up: graceful exit ("no worries if not a fit")
