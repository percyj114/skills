# Lead Scoring Customization

## How Scoring Works

Each lead is scored 0-100 across five dimensions. Configure weights and criteria in `config.json` under `scoring`.

## Default Weights

```json
{
  "scoring": {
    "threshold": 70,
    "weights": {
      "company_size_fit": 25,
      "industry_match": 25,
      "email_available": 20,
      "web_presence": 15,
      "tech_signals": 15
    }
  }
}
```
